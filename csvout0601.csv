"(CNN) - Dr. Rick Bright, the ousted director of the office involved in developing a coronavirus vaccine, formally filed an extensive whistleblower complaint Tuesday alleging his early warnings about the coronavirus were ignored and that his caution at a treatment favored by President Donald Trump led to his removal.,Bright had led the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority since 2016 until last month, when was reassigned to a narrower position at the National Institutes of Health.,In his whistleblower complaint, Bright says he raised concerns about US preparedness for coronavirus starting in January but was met with ""indifference which then developed into hostility"" by leaders at the Department of Health and Human Services.,His attorneys argue that Bright's removal from his post amounts to a violation of the Whistleblower Protection Act, claiming that Bright ""has engaged in numerous instances of protected activity."",In the complaint, he says he is seeking reinstatement as BARDA's director and asking for a full investigation.,He claims leaders at the agency were surprised by his concerns and responded slowly to the outbreak.,He alleges old disputes with HHS leadership were exacerbated by clashes over the coronavirus and that he was eventually excluded from participating in meetings about the virus.,""Dr. Bright pressed for urgent access to funding, personnel and clinical specimens, including viruses, which he emphasized were all critically necessary to begin development of lifesaving medicines needed in the likely event that the virus spread outside of Southeast Asia,"" the complaint reads. ""Secretary Azar and Dr. Kadlec responded with surprise at Dr. Bright's dire predictions and urgency."",Later, Bright claims he was cut out of critical meetings for raising early alarm about the virus.,""It was obvious that Dr. Bright's persistent demands for urgent action to respond to the pandemic had caused a 'shit storm' and a 'commotion' and were unwelcome in the office of the HHS Secretary,"" the complaint reads. ""As a result, HHS leadership excluded Dr. Bright and BARDA from these recurring meetings and from the critical discussions about addressing the COVID-19 pandemic."",© 2019 Cable News Network.

"(CNN) - The White House coronavirus task force will start to wind down later on this month, a senior White House official told CNN on Tuesday.,The official said the task force ""will be phased down around Memorial Day.

"(CNN) - The narrative seemed set: After a brief surge of public support for President Donald Trump in the early days of America's fight against the coronavirus, his approval numbers had settled back into the low 40s.,Right? Right. ,Except that in Gallup's latest two-week tracking poll, Trump's job approval is back to 49% -- matching the highest it's ever been -- while his disapproval is at 43%.,That marks a 6-point improvement on Trump's approval number from the last Gallup tracking poll. And that improvement comes exclusively from independents -- 47% of whom now approve of the job Trump is doing, the best he has ever done among that group in Gallup polling. (He was at 38% approval among indies in the last Gallup tracker.),As Gallup's Jeffrey M. Jones noted of the findings:,""During his 13th quarter in office, stretching from Jan. 20 through April 19, he averaged 47% job approval. That is four percentage points better than his previous high quarters -- 43% during his 10th (April 20-July 19, 2019) and 12th (Oct. 20, 2019-Jan 19, 2020) quarters in office."",It's worth mentioning here that it's entirely possible that this most recent Gallup poll is simply an outlier amid the broader public opinion on Trump. In fact, of the last 10 polls that asked a presidential approval question, only Gallup shows Trump's approval higher than his disapproval. Overall, the Real Clear Politics polling average shows Trump's disapproval 6 points higher than his approval.,A Monmouth poll released Tuesday showed Trump's overall job rating had slipped over the past few months, with 43% approving and 51% disapproving. ,At the same time, Gallup is Gallup -- the gold standard of public opinion polling in the country. Which means that it would be dumb to entirely write off its latest findings. ,The Point: Be wary of conventional wisdom. Especially when it concerns Trump.,© 2019 Cable News Network.

"(CNN) - The New York state Democratic presidential primary will take place as planned next month, a judge ruled Tuesday.,Last week, Democrats on the state board of elections voted to remove all the presidential candidates who had suspended their campaigns, leaving former Vice President Joe Biden as the only name on the ballot, and canceled the presidential primary due to coronavirus concerns.,The preliminary injunction, granted by United States District Judge Analisa Torres, came in response to a lawsuit from former presidential candidate and CNN contributor Andrew Yang and several New Yorkers who had hoped to serve as his delegates to the Democratic National Convention.,""I'm glad that a federal judge agreed that depriving millions of New Yorkers of the right to vote was wrong,"" Yang said in a statement. ""I hope that the New York Board of Elections takes from this ruling a newfound appreciation of their role in safeguarding our democracy."",The New York Board of Elections must ""reinstate to the Democratic primary ballot those presidential and delegate candidates who were duly qualified as of April 26, 2020, and to hold the primary election on June 23, 2020,"" the ruling said.,The New York State Board of Elections declined to comment on the ruling Tuesday night.,In her ruling, Torres wrote that Yang and the would-be delegates had ""made a clear and substantial showing of likelihood of success on the merits of their claim"" that the action by the state board had violated their constitutional rights.,This is a breaking story and will be updated.,© 2019 Cable News Network.

"PHOENIX  (CNN) - After complaining at times that he has not left the White House in months, when in reality it has been more like weeks, a restless President Donald Trump traveled to Arizona on Tuesday to nudge a pandemic-weary nation to reopen more quickly than many Americans seem to want.,The trip, seen by West Wing aides in part as a respite from the confines of the White House for Trump, also served as an opportunity for the President to persuade Americans there is a steady hand leading the US through its worst public health crisis in more than a century.,Trump projected only his usual bravado before he hopped aboard Marine One for the brief helicopter flight to Joint Base Andrews, where he would continue his cross-country journey to Arizona. It was as if the number of dead racing past the grim milestone of 70,000 was not registering, an indication that such dispiriting figures may never really affect him, at least not publicly.,""We did everything right,"" Trump said about his response to the virus. ,""The whole world is excited watching us,"" he added. ""Because we're leading the world."",The US is leading the world, but not in the way Trump thinks.,Unlike previous presidents who took time to grieve with heartbroken families during national catastrophes, in communities devastated by earthquakes or small towns wiped off the map by hurricanes, Trump did not spend time comforting residents who have lost loved ones to the virus. He sat down with a group of Native Americans and toured a Honeywell factory that is manufacturing N-95 medical masks to tout his administration's response to the virus.,""I'm going to pay my respect to a great company,"" Trump said as he left Washington.,Before he arrived in Phoenix, Trump suggested he would wear a mask at the Honeywell facility, if one were required. In other words, Trump would not lead by example.,""I think it's a mask facility, right? If it's a mask facility I will, yeah. I don't know if it's a mask facility,"" Trump said.,Despite signs at the Honeywell facility urging people inside to wear masks, however, Trump declined to follow that guidance, though he did wear safety goggles. National security adviser Robert O'Brien, chief of staff Mark Meadows and new press secretary Kayleigh McEnany also elected to forgo masks. They were standing near plant employees who were abiding by the policy as they busily constructed masks at their work stations.,A White House official said Honeywell officials had told the President's aides that masks were not necessary.,Prior to his factory tour, Trump repeatedly sidestepped questions about Vice President Mike Pence's comment to reporters indicating that the White House is considering whether to wind down the work of the coronavirus task force.,Is that a good idea during a pandemic, Trump was asked.,Trump initially dodged the question, instead touting his administration's efforts to ramp up production of ventilators and tests. The President also claimed the US leads the world in deaths from the coronavirus because it is conducting more tests than any other country. Part of Trump's comment is false -- the US still lags behind other nations in tests per 1,000 people. The other assertion -- that there is some link between the number of tests and deaths from the coronavirus -- was one of Trump's more recent inventions to explain away a mushrooming disaster.,""Mike Pence and the task force have done a great job, but we're now looking at a little bit of a different form, and that form is safety and opening, and we'll have a different group probably set up for that,"" Trump responded.,Trump also tiptoed around the question of whether he would eventually get a coronavirus vaccination when they are approved for use and become available. He would leave it up to White House doctors to decide, he said.,""I'd be first on line or I'd be last on line or I wouldn't take it at all. Whatever is best for the country,"" Trump said.,Earlier in the day, Trump eagerly defended his highly controversial response to the coronavirus as he left the White House for his trip to Phoenix, in the face of new estimates from public health experts who project a rising number of dead from the pandemic.,""That's a report with no mitigation,"" Trump said about a draft report from a John Hopkins University professor whose work was shared with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and circulated inside the administration early this week.,In fact, the report took into consideration decisions made by some state officials to relax social distancing measures and reopen portions of the US economy. But the latest models were not based on a complete cessation of these policies. ,A separate projection from the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation also forecast a sharp spike in lives lost: a total of 134,475 deaths in the US by midsummer. That model, however, notes the number of deaths could be as low as 95,092 and as high as 242,890 by August 4, far surpassing recent projections embraced by Trump.,""Models have been very inaccurate,"" Trump said, dismissing the latest estimates.,Despite the President's depiction of his response as essentially flawless, he vowed to block his administration's top health experts, like Dr. Anthony Fauci, from testifying at congressional hearings where they could presumably echo Trump's rosy assessments.,""Because the House is a setup,"" Trump said about his decision to limit testimony from administration officials such as Fauci, who has occasionally frustrated top White House aides by contradicting Trump with more clinical, science-based remarks on the pandemic. ,""The House is a bunch of Trump haters,"" the President added.,Trump left Washington clearly agitated by a new advertisement produced by a group of ""Never Trump"" Republicans who borrowed from an iconic 1984 ""Morning in America"" reelection spot for President Ronald Reagan. ""The Lincoln Project"" ad, titled ""Mourning in America,"" depicts a virus-ravaged US economy and an out-of-touch Trump.,""I would change the name to 'The Loser Project,' "" Trump said, attacking members of the group, including Washington attorney George Conway, husband of White House counselor Kellyanne Conway.,""Kellyanne must have done a big number on him,"" Trump said derisively.,As for his speech at the Honeywell facility, Trump delivered fairly standard remarks for a presidential speech.,""We will vanquish the virus,"" Trump told the crowd.,But the event had plenty of campaign overtones.  At one point, a worker took to the podium to praise Trump, just as his supporters do at the President's campaign rallies.,""All Latinos are going to vote for you,"" the unidentified man told Trump.,As the event ended, White House staffers cranked up a song by The Rolling Stones, another staple of Trump's rallies.,Despite the grim task ahead for the President, he was in campaign mode.,""It basically was a rally,"" one White House staffer quipped to a reporter about the music.,© 2019 Cable News Network.

"Washington  (CNN) - A Wisconsin Supreme Court justice on Tuesday invoked the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II during oral arguments for a challenge to the state's controversial stay-at-home order.,The comments from Justice Rebecca Bradley were made during a virtual hearing held by the seven-member panel with lawyers for both the state and the Republican-led state Legislature. The Wisconsin Legislature filed a lawsuit last month in an attempt to reopen the state and block the extension of the stay-at-home order issued by state health officials to slow the spread of the coronavirus. ,""I'll direct your attention to another time in history, in the Korematsu decision, where the (Supreme Court) said the need for action was great and time was short and that justified, and I'm quoting, 'assembling together and placing under guard all those of Japanese ancestry' in assembly centers during World War II,"" said Bradley, who was originally appointed to the court in 2015 by then-Republican Gov. Scott Walker, while addressing state assistant Attorney General Colin Roth. ,""Could the secretary under this broad delegation of legislative power or legislative-like power order people out of their homes into centers where are they are properly social distanced in order to combat the pandemic?"" she asked, adding: ""The point of my question is what are the limits, constitutional or statutory? There have to be some, don't there, counsel?"",In response to the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, then-President Franklin Roosevelt issued an executive order in 1942 forcing thousands of Japanese-Americans into internment camps. The Supreme Court upheld the order in the infamous 1944 case Korematsu v. United States, ruling that Roosevelt's order was a ""military necessity."" The court officially overturned the decision in June 2018.,The lawsuit was filed against Wisconsin's Department of Health Services Secretary-designee Andrea Palm and other health officials, who recently extended the state's ""Safer at Home"" emergency order until May 26, but loosened some restrictions on certain businesses, including golf courses, public libraries and arts and crafts stores. The suit seeks a temporary injunction against the order and a six-day stay so that a new emergency rule can be drawn up that's ""consistent with Wisconsin law."",Later during the oral arguments, Bradley suggested that the state's stay-at-home order is ""the very definition of tyranny."" ,""My question for you is where in the Constitution did the people of Wisconsin confer authority on a single unelected Cabinet secretary to compel almost six million people to stay at home and close their businesses and face imprisonment if they don't comply with no input from the legislature without the consent of the people? Isn't it the very definition of tyranny for one person to order people to be imprisoned for going to work?"" the justice asked. ,In another notable moment during Tuesday's arguments, Chief Justice Patience Roggensack, first elected to the court in 2003, appeared to downplay a flare up of coronavirus cases at a major meat packing facility in the state after Roth mentioned the cluster, saying it didn't impact ""regular folks."" ,People were infected ""due to the meat packing, though, that's where Brown County got the flare, it wasn't just the regular folks in Brown County,"" Roggensack said. ,As of Tuesday, Wisconsin had over 8,200 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 340 confirmed deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University's tally of cases in the United States.,At the end of the nearly two-hour hearing, Roggensack called the questions before the court complicated and noted that ""there's an awful lot of emotion"" tied to the case, but didn't say when the court would issue its decision.,Democratic Gov. Tony Evers, who had ordered Palm to issue the stay-at-home order in late March, had slammed the lawsuit after it was filed last month as ""focused entirely on how to get legislative Republicans more power"" and ""exploiting a global pandemic to further their attempts to undermine the will of the people."" The governor also said Republicans want his administration to ""ask for their permission to save lives."" ,© 2019 Cable News Network. Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. All Rights Reserved."
"(CNN) - Congress moved so quickly this spring to approve a staggering amount of money to respond to the coronavirus crisis that most members barely had a chance to read the bills before they voted to send them to President Donald Trump's desk.,And now efforts to oversee how the federal government is spending nearly $3 trillion of taxpayer money are sputtering along.,A new oversight panel established by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has yet to get off the ground as Republican leaders weigh boycotting the panel amid accusations it is designed to hurt Trump. A five-member commission to oversee $500 billion for big companies has only done preliminary work in part because congressional leaders have not yet agreed on a chair to lead the group, even though the law was enacted more than a month ago.,And the White House said coronavirus task force members are so consumed by responding to the crisis that they would not be available to testify before Congress this month unless explicitly approved by White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. Trump added that he wouldn't even send the nation's top infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, to testify before the House this week because the chamber is ""full of Trump haters."",With control of the White House and Congress on the line in a high-stakes election fewer than six months away, distrust is running high -- especially since the outcome is likely to be determined by how voters view Trump's leadership amid the unprecedented economic and public health crisis. ,""There is a time and a place for oversight,"" said Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican and member of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's leadership team. ""I don't believe now is the time to begin that sort of finger pointing and posturing."",Democratic leaders in the House are still planning to forge ahead -- and pointedly accuse Trump of seeking to avoid any sort of accountability, scrutiny or to comply with Congress, even with American lives on the line. They say it's part of a pattern with Trump, who has been at war with House Democrats since they took control of the chamber last year and impeached him at least in part over charges he obstructed Congress' ability to investigate his actions.,""This President has done everything in his power to undermine the Congress' constitutional responsibility to conduct oversight of the executive branch,"" House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, a Maryland Democrat, told CNN on Tuesday. ""This President has no sense of his responsibility to the Constitution, to the people of this country and to the Congress' authority to conduct oversight."",""So we're going to pursue oversight,"" he said, adding that many hearings will soon be conducted ""virtually"" with House members back in their home districts.,Both sides are still anticipating some high-profile hearings in the upcoming days -- and the latest relief package enacted late last month requires the Trump administration to submit reports to Congress, including about its testing strategy for Covid-19.,Rep. Anna Eshoo, a California Democrat who chairs a key House health subcommittee, plans to hold a May 14 hearing with Rick Bright, the ousted head of a key office who filed a whistleblower complaint alleging his warnings about the coronavirus were ignored and that he was reprimanded because he voiced skepticism about a potential treatment touted by Trump.,Later this week, National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins will testify about new tests for COVID-19 before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, while Fauci and other top health officials will testify next week before the same GOP-led panel next Tuesday about safely reopening the country.,GOP Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, the chairman of the committee, said Tuesday that the country is better served when hearing from the nation's experts about the public health crisis.,""You know I think the administration does best when they let the experts do the briefings,"" Alexander said after being asked by a reporter about the President leading daily briefings about the US response.,The Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee will convene a hearing on Wednesday about how the pandemic has threatened the airline industry. When asked if he thinks airlines need additional bailout dollars, Mississippi Sen. Roger Wicker, the panel's GOP chairman, told CNN: ""That's why we are doing oversight."",Sen. Mike Crapo, the Senate Banking Committee chairman, said he wants to bring in Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to testify. ""I'd like to do it as soon as we can,"" the Idaho Republican said.,But with the House mostly out of session for five weeks and counting and still yet to agree on how to conduct hearings virtually, and the Senate only just returning this week, congressional oversight has taken a backseat as the pandemic continues to ravage the country.,Plus, oversight requests are not being complied with, Democrats say. Indeed, the State Department did not produce records requested by House Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot Engel about Trump's decision to halt funding for the World Health Organization, and Engel, a New York Democrat, is now considering issuing a subpoena, an aide said. But that fight could take months to play out.,Late last month, the House approved the creation of a 12-member select subcommittee with sweeping power to probe the US response to the crisis. The panel, chaired by House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn, has seven Democratic members -- but House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has not yet appointed Republicans to it and will decide by the end of the week on whether he will, according to a congressional aide familiar with his thinking. He has sharply criticized the panel as a partisan attempt to undermine the President.,Pelosi has defended the panel and insisted it would focus on how taxpayer money is now being spent to root out fraud and abuse, indicating the House would wait to conduct an ""after-action"" review about Trump's initial response to the crisis. ,On Tuesday, Pelosi told CNN that ""of course"" the Democrats would proceed with the probe on the committee regardless if McCarthy names Republicans to serve on the panel. ""I hope they will"" name members, she said of Republicans.,Asked about Trump's attack that the House is full of ""Trump haters,"" Pelosi added the attack is ""not worth"" responding to.,Democratic members of the panel have already spoken about potential targets for their investigation. Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, who serves on the committee, told CNN that his fellow Democrats have three goals: ""oversight over trillions of dollars in federal money,"" a probe into the ""effectiveness of our fight against the disease and efforts to reopen the country safely"" and the ""disproportionate impact of the disease"" on some communities.,""It used to be a point of bipartisan consensus that Congress needs to conduct oversight over executive branch activities,"" Raskin added. ""Unfortunately, our GOP colleagues have now been pulled into President Trump's determination not to accept any oversight at all."",As the Democrats await the GOP decision, another body is awaiting its leader.,McConnell and Pelosi have not yet agreed to a chair for a new five-member commission to oversee the $500 billion fund to help stabilize distressed companies, a fund established by the stimulus that was approved in March. ,The House speaker said Tuesday she was ""waiting to hear back"" from McConnell and the two have been ""going back and forth"" -- but that they hoped to make a decision ""soon."",Sen. Pat Toomey, a Pennsylvania Republican who was selected by McConnell to serve on the five-member commission, said the work of the group has only been ""very preliminary"" so far.,Asked if they would be able to put together an initial report this month as required, he would only say: ""We'll see."",© 2019 Cable News Network.

"(CNN) - A new genetic analysis of  the virus that causes Covid-19 taken from more than 7,600 patients around the world shows it has been circulating in people since late last year, and must have spread extremely quickly after the first infection.,Researchers in Britain looked at mutations in the virus and found evidence of quick spread, but no evidence the virus is becoming more easily transmitted or more likely to cause serious disease.,""The virus is changing, but this in itself does not mean it's getting worse,"" genetics researcher Francois Balloux of the University College London Genetics Institute told CNN.,Balloux and colleagues pulled viral sequences from a giant global database that scientists around the world are using to share data. They looked at samples taken at different times and from different places, and said they indicate that the virus first started infecting people at the end of last year.,""This rules out any scenario that assumes SARSCoV-2 may have been in circulation long before it was identified, and hence have already infected large proportions of the population,"" Balloux's team wrote in their report, published in the journal Infection, Genetics and Evolution.,That is one piece of bad news. Some doctors had hoped the virus was circulating for many months and may have quietly infected many more people than has been reported. That would offer the hope that there might be some immunity already built up in some populations.,""Everyone was hoping for that. I was too,"" Balloux said.,Their findings pour cold water on such an idea. At the most, 10% of the global population has been exposed to the virus, Balloux estimated.,Between humans and bats,Many different studies have shown that the new coronavirus, often called SARS-CoV-2 by scientists, originated in a bat but had to have infected another animal before it jumped into humans. The first human cases were reported in Wuhan, China, last December.,Viruses make mistakes every time they replicate themselves, and these mutations can be used as what's called a molecular clock to track a virus through time and geography.,""Our results are in line with previous estimates and point to all sequences sharing a common ancestor towards the end of 2019, supporting this as the period when SARS-CoV-2 jumped into its human host,"" the team wrote.,""It's very recent,"" Balloux said. ""We are really, really, really confident that the host jump happened late last year."",That's because viral samples taken from all corners of the globe show multiple mutations, and they are similar mutations. ""Everything is everywhere,"" the team wrote.,""It has been introduced and introduced and introduced in almost all countries,"" Balloux added.,They also found genetic evidence that supports suspicions the virus was infecting people in Europe, the US and elsewhere weeks or even months before the first official cases were reported in January and February. It will be impossible to find the ""first"" patient in any country, Balloux said.,""All these ideas about trying to find a Patient Zero are pointless because there are so many patient zeros,"" he said.,Balloux's team's findings were reviewed by other experts, a process called peer review, before they were published in the journal. He said some reports by other teams, published online in what are called pre-print websites, may have drawn incorrect conclusions.,""All viruses naturally mutate. Mutations in themselves are not a bad thing and there is nothing to suggest SARS-CoV-2 is mutating faster or slower than expected. So far we cannot say whether SARS-CoV-2 is becoming more or less lethal and contagious,"" Balloux said.,Lane Warmbrod, an analyst at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security who has been tracking the reports on the genetics of the new coronavirus. She said more studies are needed in animals to demonstrate how changes in the genetics of the virus could make it more or less infectious or pathogenic., ""Just because these studies tell us these mutations are quickly spreading or becoming dominant doesn't mean anything except we know it happened. It doesn't actually tell us anything about what's happening biologically,"" Warmbrod told CNN.,Reports about mutations can be important for teams working on drugs and vaccines to fight the coronavirus. Vaccines, especially, need to target parts of the virus that are conserved -- that do not change much over time. ,© 2019 Cable News Network. Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. All Rights Reserved."
"Washington  (CNN) - Intelligence shared among Five Eyes nations indicates it is ""highly unlikely"" that the coronavirus outbreak was spread as a result of an accident in a laboratory but rather originated in a Chinese market, according to two Western officials who cited an intelligence assessment that appears to contradict claims by President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.,""We think it's highly unlikely it was an accident,"" a Western diplomatic official with knowledge of the intelligence said. ""It is highly likely it was naturally occurring and that the human infection was from natural human and animal interaction."" The countries in the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing coalition are coalescing around this assessment, the official said, and a second official, from a Five Eyes country, concurred with it. The US has yet to make a formal assessment public.,The Five Eyes alliance is made up of the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand -- and the countries share a broad range of intelligence in one of the world's tightest multilateral arrangements.,The assessment from members of the exclusive intelligence-sharing group seems to undermine forceful claims by Trump and Pompeo in recent days, as they have doubled down on the assertion that the outbreak originated from a laboratory in Wuhan, China, rather than a market in the same region.,It will likely increase pressure on the Trump administration to provide evidence to back up its claim, which it has failed to do so far despite the increasingly aggressive rhetoric from the President and his top diplomat. ,A third source, also from a Five Eyes nation, told CNN that the level of certainty being expressed by Pompeo and Trump is way out in front of where the current Five Eyes assessment is. This source acknowledged that there is still a possibility that the virus originated from a laboratory, but cautioned there is nothing to make that a legitimate theory yet.,The source added that ""clearly the market is where it exploded from,"" but how the virus got to the market remains unclear.,But without greater cooperation and transparency from the Chinese it's impossible to say with total certainty, the first official added.,The third source said it is also possible the US is not sharing all of its intelligence. While the overwhelming majority is shared among the Five Eyes members, there are pockets of information that each country keeps to itself.,In an interview with National Geographic that published on Monday, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, said he doesn't believe the virus originated in a lab.,""If you look at the evolution of the virus in bats and what's out there now, (the scientific evidence) is very, very strongly leaning toward this could not have been artificially or deliberately manipulated, "" Fauci told the magazine, adding that he doesn't believe that the virus somehow escaped a lab into society.,""... Everything about the stepwise evolution over time strongly indicates that (this virus) evolved in nature and then jumped species."",The assessment follows repeated claims by Trump and Pompeo that there is evidence the virus originated at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.,""I can tell you that there is a significant amount of evidence that this came from that laboratory in Wuhan,"" Pompeo told ABC News on Sunday.,The US intelligence community issued a statement on Thursday saying it is still working to ""determine whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan."" The statement said that the Covid-19 virus was not manmade or genetically modified.,The Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the State Department did not respond to CNN's requests for comment.,A senior Office of Director of National Intelligence official said Monday night that the US has evidence for both theories., ""We regularly share intelligence with our partners on a variety of threats and Covid is no different,"" the senior official told CNN. ""The IC stands by the statement that the ODNI released last Thursday and we underscore three points: the IC believes the virus started in China. We're down to two theories and have evidence on both. We agree that it does not appear to have been purposeful."",Earlier Monday, a nationalist tabloid controlled by the Chinese Communist Party dismissed claims by the Trump administration that the novel coronavirus originated from a laboratory, as the war of words over the pandemic escalates between Washington and Beijing.,Responding to Pompeo's comments that there was ""enormous evidence"" to support the theory, China's state-owned Global Times newspaper said in an editorial that the former CIA director had ""stunned the world with groundless accusations."",""Since Pompeo said his claims are supported by 'enormous evidence,' then he should present this so-called evidence to the world, and especially to the American public who he continually tries to fool,"" the editorial said.,""The truth is that Pompeo does not have any evidence, and during Sunday's interview, he was bluffing."",CNN reached out to China's Foreign Ministry for comment on Pompeo's claims, but has not received a response. The country is in the middle of a five-day holiday that runs through Tuesday.,Scientists around the world have condemned conspiracy theories suggesting that the coronavirus does not have a natural origin, pointing to studies that suggest it originated in wildlife.,China has faced criticism at home and abroad over its handling of the virus, especially during the initial outbreak. It was accused of silencing whistleblowers and delaying informing the public about the severity of the crisis.,But critics allege the Trump administration has ramped up efforts to blame China for the global spread of the virus as it faces growing criticism at home for its own handling of the pandemic. To date, the US has recorded more than 1.1 million cases and at least 68,000 deaths related to Covid-19.,This story has been updated with developments from China earlier Monday, plus background and context.,© 2019 Cable News Network.

"Editor's Note: Peter Bergen is CNN's national security analyst, a vice president at New America and a professor of practice at Arizona State University. He is the editor of the Coronavirus Daily Brief and author of the new book ""Trump and His Generals: The Cost of Chaos."" The opinions expressed here are his own. Read more opinion at CNN.,(CNN) - The Trump administration has made any number of mistakes as it has grappled with the worst crisis since World War II; if it goes through with its plans to wind down its coronavirus task force around Memorial Day that decision will surely rank among the worst. ,It's as if in 1942, three years before Germany was defeated, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt had said, ""Gee, it's well past time to wrap up this tiresome war against the Nazis."", ,The coronavirus task force has provided much-needed scientific and public health expertise to President Donald Trump, who generally places great store on the findings of his own gut rather than on the findings of experts. Trump, understandably, wants to change the narrative from fighting the virus to opening up the economy, but biology won't be so easily corralled., ,Consider first the carnage yet to come caused by the virus. An internal Trump administration model suggests that there could be 3,000 deaths a day by June. Put another way, in a couple of months from now we may see the equivalent toll of a 9/11 attack every day in the United States. Michael Osterholm, a leading American infectious disease expert, estimates there could be 800,000 COVID-19 deaths in the United States over the next 18 months. That is Osterholm's low-end estimate., ,Consider also that there are swarms of unanswered questions about how to deal with the coronavirus, which won't be wished away by wrapping up the task force.,As has been widely observed, there is a dearth of testing for the virus, despite President Trump's incessant claims to the contrary. According to the COVID Tracking Project there have been more than 7 million tests performed, which is only around 2% of the American population.,For normal life to return, a Harvard study recommends 5 million tests per day in the United States by early June and 20 million tests per day by mid-summer. The US isn't anywhere remotely close to that goal. , ,There is also a great deal of uncertainty about the efficacy of available antibody tests, which if they were reliable, could at least theoretically allow those who are shown to have antibodies to the coronavirus to return to workplaces and to socialize normally. , ,Meanwhile, it's not at all clear what ""immunity"" to the coronavirus actually confers. Last month the World Health Organization warned that antibody tests showing that you have been exposed to the virus don't necessarily mean you can't be re-infected. , ,And there is widespread agreement among scientists that there will be a ""second wave"" of infections in the fall., ,Trump's own Centers for Disease Control Director Robert Redfield angered the President when he told the Washington Post last month that this second wave could possibly ""be even more difficult than the one we just went through."" In Washington DC, a gaffe is sometimes defined as telling the truth in public. When Redfield was summoned to the White House to clear up his ""misquote"" in front of President Trump, Redfield instead doubled down and said that the second wave ""was going to be more difficult and potentially complicated."", ,Then, what to make of supposed success stories such as the efficient authoritarian city state of Singapore? Singapore was held up as a model of how to deal with the coronavirus in March, but last month clusters of cases appeared in dormitories for migrant workers and Singapore now has the most cases in Southeast Asia.,Finally, while it's ""on paper"" possible that there will be a vaccine available by January -- as Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, told Fox News on Sunday -- it's also ""on paper"" possible that Trump will finally get his fervent wish and be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his gone-nowhere diplomacy with North Korea., ,Don't bet the farm on either eventuality. England's Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty said publicly last month there is an ""incredibly small"" chance of having an effective vaccine for coronavirus by early 2021. , ,It's these kinds of numerous unsettled issues about how to deal with the coronavirus that the Trump administration needs continuous expert scientific advice about. Trump has said Birx and others will continue to provide scientific guidance to him. But formally dissolving the coronavirus task force signals a lack of seriousness about the threat posed by Covid-19. Don't do it.,© 2019 Cable News Network. Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.

"(CNN) - Public spaces were filled with visitors over the weekend as some states began loosening lockdown measures and experts now warn the premature reopening could drive up the country's coronavirus death toll -- by nearly double, according to one prediction.,In the past two weeks, governors across the country introduced plans for phased reopenings amid mounting pressure from residents and businesses who are fearful of devastating economic impacts of lockdowns. ,But the alternative could be worse. ,""It's the balance of something that's a very difficult choice,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, the country's leading infectious disease expert, told CNN Monday night. ""How many deaths and how much suffering are you willing to accept to get back to what you want to be some form of normality, sooner rather than later?"",At least 42 states will be partially reopened through May 10, including California -- the first state to implement a sweeping stay-at-home order -- where some stores will be allowed to reopen this week.,A model from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington is now predicting the US could see 134,475 deaths by early August --- a massive spike since its previous prediction of 74,000 deaths just last week. ,Tracking the virus,A separate model from the Trump administration is also projecting that cases and deaths will rise in the next weeks, with the death toll reaching 3,000 daily victims by June 1, according to an internal document obtained by The New York Times. ,So far, the US has recorded more than 1,180,600 infections and at least 68,934 deaths. Over the weekend, parks in New York City and Atlanta drew crowds as residents began venturing out of their homes. In the city of Miami Beach, more than 7,300 warnings were issued to people who weren't wearing face covers, while more than 470 warnings were given to those who failed to practice social distancing.,Forgetting about social distancing measures too quickly can result in a rebound, Fauci says. And that's highly likely with a virus that he says can spread ""like wildfire."",""It has a phenomenal capability and efficiency in spreading from person to person,"" Fauci said Monday. ""This virus has enormous capabilities of spreading like wildfire. We know that."",The answers to your coronavirus questions,How governors are moving forward,California was one of the states where crowds gathered over the weekend -- thousands of protesters descended on the state's Capitol and an Orange County beach to protest social distancing orders from the governor. ,On Monday, the governor announced retail shops in the state -- including clothing stores, florists and book shops -- can begin to reopen on Friday, after health officials said the state was meeting important metrics including sufficient test and tracing capacity.,Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said he didn't think his city would reopen this week, saying Monday that despite the governor's announcement, different parts of the state may see different timelines for reopening. ,In Michigan, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said the lockdown will continue ""until at least May 15,"" warning that reopening the state too soon could lead to a second shutdown.,Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, who has laid out a phased reopening approach for the state, said Monday the numbers in Kentucky are ""really steady"" even with an increase in testing. ,When he was asked why the state had forgone the recommended benchmark of seeing a 14-day decline in cases before beginning to reopen he said, ""I will tell you, I never thought we'd be plateaued for three weeks, that's a great thing with more testing."",And in Mississippi, Gov. Tate Reeves took a more aggressive approach, releasing new guidelines that go into effect this week. ,Those include allowing outdoor gatherings of up to 20 people.,Saying he knows the virus doesn't do well in the sun or heat, he added, ""to be outdoors is about the safest place you can be."",The governor's plan also allows dining service in restaurants --  as long as the institutions follow guidelines provided by the state, including a mandatory deep cleaning.,""I don't want to wait if there are steps that we believe we can safely take now to ease the burden on Mississippians fighting this virus,"" he said. ,This is where states stand on reopening,Protests against masks,As health officials and businesses navigate safe reopenings, many communities -- and the federal government -- have urged Americans to wear face coverings when they're in public and in parts of the US it's now required. ,But those guidelines have also seen pushback --  most recently in Michigan's Capitol building, where hundreds of protesters showed up -- most of whom, were not covering their face. ,On Friday, a security guard was shot in the head and killed after telling a customer at a Michigan Family Dollar store to wear a face mask. The governor required face masks in enclosed public spaces in late April. Three people have been charged. ,In Stillwater, Oklahoma, an emergency proclamation issued to require face masks in stores and restaurants was amended a day later after store employees were ""threatened with physical violence and showered with verbal abuse,"" Stillwater City Manager Norman McNickle said in a statement.,And in San Diego County, a supermarket customer wore a Ku Klux Klan-style hood to cover his face and only removed it at the cashier despite having been repeatedly asked to multiple times before, CNN affiliate KSWB reported. ,© 2019 Cable News Network.

"(CNN) - President Donald Trump now knows the price of the haunting bargain required to reopen the country -- tens of thousands more lives in a pandemic that is getting worse not better.,It's one he now appears ready to pay, if not explain to the American people, at a moment of national trial that his administration has constantly underplayed.,Depressing new death toll projections and infection data on Monday dashed the optimism stirred by more than half the country taking various steps to reopen an economy that is vital to Trump's reelection hopes and has shed more than 30 million jobs. Stay-at-home orders slowed the virus and flattened the curve in hotspots like New York and California, but they have so far failed to halt its broader advance, leaving the nation stuck on a grim plateau of about 30,000 new cases a day for nearly a month.,New evidence of the likely terrible future toll of Covid-19 came on a day when Trump stayed out of sight -- his wild briefings that hurt his political prospects now paused -- meaning he could not be questioned on his enthusiasm for state openings in the light of new evidence.,The White House also took new steps to limit testimony to the House from members of the President's coronavirus task force, prompting Democratic Speaker Nancy Pelosi to warn on CNN that it was ""afraid of the truth."",Trump, who has consistently appeared to care most about his political prospects during three miserable months, mounted another victory lap on Monday -- boasting on Twitter that he was finally getting ""great reviews"" for his virus management.,A new model from the University of Washington, previously used by the White House suggested that 134,000 Americans could now die by August -- in a revised toll prompted by the likely impact of state openings. The total was more than double the same organization's estimate last month.,A draft internal report by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention obtained by The New York Times buckled the White House narrative that the worst of the pandemic is passed and it's time to get going again. It found that the daily death toll will reach about 3,000 by June 1, nearly double the current number.,The data, combined with figures showing the pandemic getting worse in many states showed there is no real scientific case for reopening businesses, bars and restaurants. It underscored how governors -- largely in the absence of a vast nationwide testing and tracing operation the administration has failed to build -- are in many cases flying blind in reopening their states.,Trump's top coronavirus task force adviser, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said he did not know the assumptions behind the new models but said they were probably not misleading in that easing restrictions would lead to spikes in infection.,""It's the balance of something that's a very difficult choice,"" Fauci said on CNN's ""Cuomo Prime Time,"" putting the bargain in the form of a question the American people must resolve.,""How many deaths and how much suffering are you willing to accept to get back to what you want to be, some form of normality, sooner rather than later?"" he asked.,""I feel I have a moral obligation to give the kind of information that I'm giving. People are going to make their own choices."",The harsh choice between life and prosperity, ,But the nearly 70,000 Americans who have already died are not the only victims of the worst public health threat in 100 years.,Thirty million Americans were thrown out of work by lockdowns -- and their plight suggests that whatever the science dictates, there is no economic case for keeping businesses closed.,There is no doubt that Trump and state and local leaders are facing terrible choices after weeks of social isolation and economic damage.,But Trump has declined to initiate a national conversation about the hideous compromises ahead.,The callous undercurrent of Monday's data is that with no vaccine in sight, the country faces an awful choice about the relative pain in disease and economic blight it is ready to endure.,One political figure who is broaching these issues is former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie -- though in retirement the Republican friend of Trump is spared the fateful decisions that serving politicians face.,""Of course, everybody wants to save every life they can -- but the question is, towards what end, ultimately?"" Christie told CNN's Dana Bash on The Daily DC Podcast. ,""We've got to let some of these folks get back to work, because if we don't, we're going to destroy the American way of life in these families -- and it will be years and years before we can recover."" ,Trump, however, prefers, as always, to dwell in the universe that is most conducive to his political hopes. He stepped up attacks on China for covering up a crisis he predicted would never be a problem for the US despite available evidence. He effectively accused the intelligence agencies and his own subordinates of not briefing him on the virus until late January. Even if that is true -- and well sourced reports suggest it is not -- there was ample news coverage about a possible new pandemic.,In a Fox News town hall on Sunday, the President, who has consistently said he sees ""light at the end of the tunnel,"" chided some states for not opening quickly enough and misrepresented the current national picture of the pandemic.,""There's not too many states that I know of that are going up. Almost everybody is headed in the right direction,"" the President said, adding, ""I like the states opening. They will be opening. They're going to open safely and quickly."",Last week, on Fox News, Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner insisted that the ""data's on our side and President Trump has created a pathway to safely reopen our country."",But the fresh data on Monday revealed the price of opening and undercut the administration narrative that but for a few unfortunate hotspots the rest of the nation is safe.,New projected death toll based on state openings, ,The model from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, often cited by the White House, forecast that 134,000 people will die of Covid-19 in the United States by August.,Ali Mokdad, a professor of Health Metrics Sciences at IHME, told CNN that the rise in forecast cases was based on increased mobility before the ""premature relaxation"" of social distancing and new outbreaks in the Midwest.,States such as Minnesota and Illinois have sharply rising infection curves, and few states yet satisfy the White House guidelines for 14 days of falling infections before reopening is contemplated. Trump however has not spoken out to ensure the guidelines are followed. ,Former Food and Drug Administration commissioner Scott Gottlieb warned in a Wall Street Journal op-ed that while mitigation hadn't failed, social distancing and other measures hadn't ""brought the number of new cases and deaths down as much as expected or stopped the epidemic from expanding."",On CNN's ""New Day"" on Monday, Andy Slavitt, a former top Obama administration public health expert warned if New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, which have peaked, are excepted, US coronavirus infections are rising at a 20% rate.,""While we have been staying indoors we have been slowing down the spread. What we haven't done is get rid of the virus. The virus is still out there,"" Slavitt said.,Jarring signs that the pandemic will kill more people than the administration had hoped even several weeks ago, come early in a week that will end with new unemployment figures that could approach levels last seen in the 1930s Great Depression.,The data will bolster critics who say stay-at-home orders must be lifted to get Americans back to work -- a position the White House seems increasingly to be adopting.,The White House has blocked Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, from testifying before the House Appropriations Committee's subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies regarding Covid-19 response.,White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany on Saturday said Fauci was prohibited from testifying because committee members did not provide enough details to explain why Fauci needed to participate.,He is, however, still expected to appear before a committee in the Republican-led Senate.,A senior administration official said that top public health officials needed to focus on their work not in delivering testimony.,That did not appear to stop them having to spend hours on end standing beside Trump during the stem-winder briefings that have now been halted.,© 2019 Cable News Network.

"(CNN) - The World Naked Bike Ride usually sees thousands of nude cyclists baring it all as they ride through cities around the world. But of course, with the coronavirus pandemic, this year's event will be a little bit different.,While canceled in other cities -- including in St. Louis, London and San Francisco -- the Portland, Oregon, chapter has instead announced that the show must go on, just with a little more social distancing than usual.,Instead of gathering at a set location and time, anyone who wishes to participate are simply encouraged to strip down, hop on, and ride wherever and whenever they'd like, event organizers announced Tuesday.,The World Naked Bike Ride will now be celebrated, instead, as World Naked Bike Ride Day. It's June 27th -- save the date.,""It might take even more courage than usual, but if any city has the creativity to make it fun, it's Portland,"" said Pedalpalooza, the organization that oversees the massive annual event.,The organizers first announced last month that the city's Naked Bike Ride would look a little bit different this year due to the pandemic. ,""We simply must put the safety of Portlanders first,"" organizers wrote in a Facebook post at the time. ""We are bigger than the virus, and even if we have to ride circles in our living rooms in the buff, we will ride on."" ,The annual event, which last year saw 10,000 participants in varying degrees of undress, is meant to protest against society's dependency on oil as well as promote cyclist safety and body positivity. While public nudity is illegal in Portland, the Naked Bike Ride has been allowed because it is an official protest. ,It's not clear, though, what that means for participants riding around nude by themselves.,CNN reached out to the Portland Police for comment.

"(CNN) - He oversaw the public health response to a pandemic. ,He advised Americans to cancel social gatherings and wear masks in public. ,He warned of a disease resurgence if restrictions were lifted too soon.,He was also born in the 19th century. ,Before there was Dr. Anthony Fauci, there was Dr. Thomas Tuttle, a Washington health commissioner who shepherded the state through the devastating 1918 influenza pandemic. ,The comparison was first made in a Forbes piece published in April. ,A century separates the two physicians, and they worked under different circumstances: Tuttle was a state official and Fauci is a national advisor on coronavirus. Tuttle communicated his health recommendations via telegram and Fauci appears weekly on TV. And the pandemics of their eras were two very different beasts. ,But the two have shared similar advice for ending pandemics -- social distancing, masks and quarantine among them. And it doesn't hurt that the two bespectacled physicians look alike. ,He raised the notion of asymptomatic transmission,In battling the 1918 influenza pandemic, Tuttle raised the notion of asymptomatic transmission, though he didn't call it that. ,In the Washington Board of Health's Twelfth Biennial Report, published in 1919, Tuttle wrote that a ""carrier"" was a ""person who has been exposed to a disease but who is apparently immune from that disease, and yet will carry with him or her the germs of the disease and transmit them to others."" ,He noted that among passengers on a steamship traveling from Nome, Alaska, to Seattle, Washington, 150 of them showed signs of influenza. This was despite no reported cases of influenza in Nome -- proof that the vessel must have carried asymptomatic passengers. ,Now, community spread is a hallmark of the virus. Fauci said he believed asymptomatic transmission was occurring in January, two months before the coronavirus would become a pandemic. ,Asymptomatic transmission is the reason health officials today changed their stance on masks. ,He recommended strict rules,Like Fauci, Tuttle asked the public to make fairly drastic changes to weaken the virus's spread -- and that includes social distancing and wearing masks. ,""All public gatherings except those absolutely essential to the maintenance of life and to the prosecution of essential war industries were prohibited,"" Tuttle wrote. ,He advised people to wear masks in public and quarantine themselves (to the chagrin of the public, but more on that below), too. In a retrospective, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that these efforts were ""applied unevenly."" ,His strategy for Washington state seemed to work, though: With early intervention and a nascent vaccine, Tuttle wrote that the death rate from influenza in the state was ""as low as any state in the US, if not lower than any other state."" ,Meanwhile, in the 21st century, early April evidence suggested that stay-at-home orders were slowing the rate of infection, the death rate is suspected to rise now that most US states are reopen. ,He faced pushback ,As with Fauci, not every arm of the government -- or the public -- agreed with Tuttle's proposed restrictions.  ,In a telegram to the US Public Health Service, Tuttle asked how long a period of quarantine should last for patients with the virus. ,""Service does not recommend quarantine against influenza,"" the service responded. ,In 1918, after about six weeks of social distancing (though it wasn't called that then), Tuttle wrote that restrictions were lifted -- and within two weeks, infection rates quickly grew.,Meanwhile, Fauci has disagreed with President Donald Trump on a number of the latter's claims: Trump touted the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for coronavirus, while Fauci warned of its dangers. Trump originally hoped to open the country by April 12, a date Fauci called an ""aspirational projection."" And Fauci has some reservations about the majority of states reopening this month. ,He warned of a resurgence,Despite the progress the state and nation had made in quelling the pandemic, Tuttle warned of a resurgence later in the season. Though the 1918 influenza outbreak began in the fall and peaked in winter, he warned that it could peak again in the following winter after a relatively mild summer. ,""Our fight with this disease is not finished,"" he wrote. ""In fact, we are simply in the midst of it. We must, therefore, be prepared to meet the situation."" ,He turned out to be right -- the pandemic stretched into spring 1919. By its end, at least 50 million people worldwide had died from it, including 675,000 Americans. ,The coronavirus death toll in America isn't suspected to near that -- more than 135,000 deaths is the latest figure cited by the White House -- but a US resurgence is all but guaranteed. ,""I'm almost certain it will come back, because the virus is so transmissible and it's globally spread,"" Fauci said during an Economic Club of Washington webinar last week.,Fauci predicted the coronavirus will resurge in the US in the fall and winter, just as flu season kicks off. To prepare for it, Americans must be ready to resume stay-at-home orders at a moment's notice. ,© 2019 Cable News Network. Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. All Rights Reserved."
"(CNN) - A Georgia district attorney is recommending that the case of a man who was chased, shot and killed while running more than two months ago go to a grand jury, according to a news release obtained by CNN.  ,Ahmaud Arbery, 25, was jogging in a Brunswick neighborhood February 23 when a former police officer and his son chased him down, telling officers later that they thought he looked like the suspect in a series of recent break-ins in the area, authorities said. ,Tom Durden, the district attorney for the Atlantic Judicial Circuit, wrote he expects to present the case to the next available grand jury in Glynn County to consider whether charges are merited for those involved in Arbery's death.,Because of the coronavirus pandemic, courts are currently prohibited from empaneling grand juries. ,Durden did not return CNN's calls on Tuesday for comment, but the local branch of the NAACP provided CNN with the document -- labeled as a press release -- which matches a statement Durden gave to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.,S. Lee Merritt, an attorney for the Arbery family, said in a statement obtained by CNN that the two men involved in the chase ""must be taken into custody pending their indictment."",Mother says son was unarmed,Wanda Cooper, Arbery's mother, told CNN on Sunday that when police notified her of her son's death, she was told her son was involved in a burglary and that there was a confrontation between her son and the homeowner and a struggle over a gun. ,""He was not armed,"" Cooper said. She said she never worried about him jogging because he wasn't bothering anyone.  ,There have been no charges against the father and son involved in the incident, former police officer Gregory McMichael and his son Travis. CNN previously reached out to Gregory McMichael for comment, but he said he won't be commenting because he is under investigation. ,""This is an ongoing investigation,"" the Glynn County Police Department said in a statement April 28, adding that it ""continues to gather and provide information to the District Attorney's Office that the case has been assigned to."" ,Two other district attorneys had recused themselves over possible conflicts of interest, one of whom wrote that Travis McMichael acted out of self-defense and their actions fell within Georgia's citizen arrest laws. ,Merritt, the family's attorney, told CNN on Sunday, ""The decision to rely on the citizen's arrest statute is really a recent invention, prior to that they just simply said it was self-defense."" Merritt says now the men are trying to use the law to say they were trying to stop a crime. ,""According to that law, you actually have to be observing the crime or be in the immediate knowledge of the crime,"" Merritt said. ""The only thing they have ever said is ... that Ahmaud stopped by a house that was under construction and he looked through the window. We don't know if that happened or not, but even if that did happen that is not a felony that would invoke the citizen's arrest statute that would make this allowable."" ,'We expect action this week',After the shooting, Gregory McMichael told police he saw the same man ""the other night"" and that he stuck his hand down his pants on that occasion, leading McMichael to believe he was armed, according to a Glynn County Police report.  ,After seeing Arbery jogging, McMichael then alerted his 34-year-old son, Travis, according to the police report. ,""Travis, the guy is running down the street, let's go,"" McMichael said, according to the report. ,The two grabbed a shotgun and a pistol and followed Arbery in their truck, police said. Travis McMichael, the driver, followed Arbery and then attempted to cut him off, the report said. Arbery turned around and began running in the opposite direction, the police report said. ,They chased Arbery to a nearby intersection where they caught up to him, the report said. ,""Stop, stop, we want to talk to you,"" Gregory McMichael shouted at Arbery, according to the police report. ,Travis McMichael then exited truck with the shotgun, the police report said. His father told officers Arbery ""violently attacked"" his son, the report said, and they struggled over the gun. Travis McMichael fired two shots, the report said, and Arbery fell. ,At best, the men had the authority to follow Arbery and send law enforcement to that location, Merritt said. The 911 calls show the call taker was asking the men what Arbery is doing that was of criminal concern, Merritt said.  ,""They didn't give any answer for that, they said, 'He's a black man running down our road,'"" Merritt said. ,Defenders of the men are also pointing to a shoplifting conviction in Arbery's past. ,""The reference to ... alleged conduct from high school or shoplifting is absurd and has nothing to do with his murder,"" Merritt said. ,© 2019 Cable News Network.

"Washington  (CNN) - Scientists who are part of the Trump administration's coronavirus vaccine project have identified 14 vaccines to focus on for development, according to a senior administration official. ,Those involved in the effort expect to have six to eight of the vaccines being tested make it to subsequent rounds of trials, the official said. Officials hope to have three to four vaccines make it through final testing and be made available, but that depends on how the testing and clinical trials proceed and how successful they are.,""Operation Warp Speed"" seeks to quickly ramp up production, organize distribution and determine who gets the first doses of a potential vaccine. The goal -- which may prove impossible to meet -- is to make 100 million doses of the vaccine available by November, 200 million doses by December and 300 million doses by January, a senior administration official has told CNN.,Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, has suggested January as a potential date for a vaccine, but vaccines typically take years to produce.,NBC News first reported that the administration is eyeing 14 potential vaccines.,""We are very confident we are going to have a vaccine by the end of the year,"" President Donald Trump said Sunday night at a Fox News town hall.,Last week, Fauci said ""if everything falls into place right"" there could be a coronavirus vaccine by January -- but added there are ""a number of situations that could go wrong."" He also mentioned the potential risks of experimental coronavirus vaccines and urged more testing.,""It may all of a sudden have a safety signal,"" Fauci said during a CNN Global Town Hall -- Coronavirus: Facts and Fears. ""If it doesn't work, it doesn't protect people. I've been involved in vaccine work for decades. Not every vaccine we went after worked."" ,He continued, ""That's an assumption that it's going to be safe, that it's going to be effective and we're going to be able to do it quickly. I think each of those are not only feasible, but maybe likely. That's what I mean when I say by January we'll do it. But I can't guarantee it."" ,The scientific community has faced immense pressure to find a vaccine -- a process that is typically measured in years, not months, and Operation Warp Speed has essentially received a blank check from the administration. CNN has reported that a director of the project is expected to be announced this week.,Vaccine trials usually start with testing in animals before launching into a three-phase process. The first phase involves injecting the vaccine into a small group of people to assess safety and monitor their immune response.,The second phase ramps up the number of people -- often into the hundreds, and often including more members of at-risk groups -- for a randomized trial.,If the results are promising, the trial moves to phase-three test for efficacy and safety with thousands or tens of thousands of people, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.,That undertaking can make for a daunting timeline, but vaccines are seen as the holy grail. If the US population can be successfully vaccinated for the coronavirus, that would make it easier for the country to fully reopen.,The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the United States has topped more than 1 million and more than 67,000 people have died as of mid-Monday morning.,© 2019 Cable News Network.

"Wellington, New Zealand  (CNN) - It may be some time before tourists are traveling the globe again. But what if you could travel through designated, approved parts of it?,Politicians from Australia and New Zealand are discussing the possibility of opening up borders to each other, creating a travel corridor -- or ""travel bubble"" -- between the two nations.,Both countries almost completely shut their borders to foreigners in March, a huge blow to their respective tourism industries. But with both appearing to have successfully brought their coronavirus outbreaks under control, politicians are now talking about when borders could be opened to each other.,""If there is any country in the world with whom we can reconnect with first, undoubtedly that's New Zealand,"" Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said last month. ,""That is a situation we would all like to be in, but of course, our number one focus at the moment is making sure that both our countries are in the position where we're domestically managing Covid-19 to a point where we can with confidence open borders,"" New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on April 27. ,""One thing I'm not willing to do is jeopardize the position that New Zealand has got itself into by moving too soon to open our borders -- even to Australia."",It's not clear when this ""bubble"" could become a reality -- currently both countries still have domestic travel restrictions in place, and all international arrivals are subject to a 14-day quarantine.,Travel industry experts say August is when the corridor is likely to be rolled out, possibly in time for the ski season in New Zealand and the school holidays in September. ,A special relationship,There are a few reasons why New Zealand and Australia would be each other's first pick.,Although the two countries are separated by about 2,000 km (1,243 miles) of sea, they have one of the closest bilateral relationships in the world. Australian passport holders can travel and work in New Zealand indefinitely without a visa, and vice versa.,The two countries also contribute heavily to each other's tourism industry.,Australians make up almost 40% of international arrivals to New Zealand, and around 24% of New Zealand's international visitor spend. That's especially significant in New Zealand, where tourism is the country's biggest export industry. (Tourism is considered an export industry because it involves foreign cash being used to buy New Zealand's goods and services.),Over in Australia, New Zealanders make up around 15% of the country's international visitors, and only about 6% of the international visitor spend. Tourism is still worth billions to Australia, although it is only the country's fourth biggest export industry.,In both countries, tourism industries have taken a massive hit from the coronavirus outbreak -- so it's no surprise that industry representatives are welcoming the prospect of a travel bubble. ,""The message from the industry side is that the bubble is a goer,"" said Simon Westaway, the executive director of the Australian Tourism Industry Council, adding that it was the only way of getting international tourism into Australia in the near future.,""If we can add in the Australians, that would be enormously beneficial for the survival of tourism businesses and thousands of jobs,"" said Chris Roberts, the chief executive of Tourism Industry Aotearoa, which represents the tourism industry in New Zealand. He added that the amount tourists spend in New Zealand had dropped by at least 2 billion New Zealand dollars ($1.22 billion) a month.,But Roberts isn't expecting the levels of Australian tourists that New Zealand had pre-Covid -- he thinks many would opt to just travel domestically. ,In Australia, some tour operators had been focusing their attention on China, which makes up about 15% of travelers to Australia but 27% of total tourist spend. Westaway said those businesses would need to adapt and work out how to appeal to more Kiwi travelers.,How would it work?,One thing to keep in mind: Australia is made up of states and territories, and some of those currently have additional quarantine rules in place. For instance, a person traveling from Sydney (in New South Wales) to Brisbane (in Queensland) would need to undergo a 14-day self-quarantine period.,Airports may also need to roll out new procedures.,Roberts envisions a future where tourists may turn up to the airport, be tested for Covid-19 and only be allowed on the plane once they've got a negative result. Once they are at their destination, they may have their temperature checked. Travelers may need to supply more information than usual so they can be easily traced, if necessary. ,Both Roberts and Westaway believe the bubble would only work if the current 14-day quarantine period for anyone entering the country is removed.,Once the trans-Tasman bubble is tried and tested, New Zealand could look to include other territories in its bubble -- perhaps Taiwan and Hong Kong, Roberts said. ,""I think it will be on a country by country basis,"" he said. ""A general opening of borders could be a very long time away."",Could the bubble get bigger?,There's also some discussion about broadening the bubble to include the Pacific Islands. ,From a health perspective, the Pacific Island nations appear to have escaped the coronavirus outbreak largely unscathed. Fiji -- the worst affected Pacific Island nation -- has reported only 18 coronavirus cases and no deaths. Guam -- which is a US territory and not a nation -- has reported more than 140 coronavirus cases and five deaths. ,Many Pacific Island nations closed borders early to protect against potential spread.,But the pandemic has hurt tourism to the Pacific Islands, one of the most aid-dependent regions in the world.,Ardern has urged caution on including the Pacific, saying: ""Our Pacific neighbors in large part have not been afflicted by Covid-19, and the last thing we would want is to risk that."",But broadening Australia and New Zealand's travel bubble to at least some Pacific Islands would help boost the islands' tourism industry, said Stephen Howes, the director of the Development Policy Center at Australian National University in Canberra. ,""For a lot of people, it's very tough,"" he said of the effect on tourism in the Pacific. ""Some have gone back to their village ... people are just struggling to get by."",""Obviously no country would be forced to do this,"" he said, adding that the travel corridor could always be stopped if it didn't work. ""It would be a complex undertaking ... but it's certainly worth trying."",And including the Pacific would also help Australia and New Zealand, allowing migrant workers to enter both countries. The inclusion could also have a huge soft power impact in the region, which is of strategic importance to New Zealand, Australia and China. ,""This is a real test,"" Howes said. ""If Australia and New Zealand go ahead and just have a trans-Tasman partnership, they could really antagonize the Pacific. It would be like, 'well you don't really care.'"",Roberts agreed that the bubble would benefit the Pacific, saying that without tourism, their economies are in significant trouble. ,""In terms of economic aid to our Pacific neighbors, that would be the best thing we could do for them -- as long as we could do it safely."",Is this the future of travel?,A potential Australia and New Zealand travel bubble may end up being a model for the rest of the world, Roberts and Westaway say.,Like other countries around the world, New Zealand and Australia will need to be careful not to move too fast and create a second Covid-19 wave. ,Moving too fast could also jeopardize their image with international tourists, who view the countries as clean, trustworthy places.,But generally, Roberts and Westaway are hopeful. ,""If (the detail) can be worked out between New Zealand and Australia, then they can be applied to other places as well,"" Roberts said.,""There's quite a lot of attention paid to this part of the world now because of the apparent success of New Zealand and Australia containing the virus outbreak. If we can also then come up with a way to resume travel between countries, I'm sure the rest of the world will be taking a very keen interest to see how that works."",© 2019 Cable News Network.

"(CNN) - There's new evidence that the coronavirus may have been in France weeks earlier than was previously thought.,Doctors at a Paris hospital say they've found evidence that one patient admitted in December was infected with Covid-19. If verified, this finding would show that the virus was already circulating in Europe at that time -- well before the first known cases were diagnosed in France or hotspot Italy.,""Covid-19 was already spreading in France in late December 2019, a month before the official first cases in the country,"" the team at Groupe Hospitalier Paris Seine in Saint-Denis wrote in a study published Sunday in the International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents.,The first official reports of Covid-19 in France were reported on Jan. 24, in two people who had a history of travel to Wuhan, China.,Intensive care specialist Dr. Yves Cohen and his hospital colleagues wrote that they decided to check the records of earlier patients, in case the virus had been spreading undetected.,Researchers in the US have also started finding evidence that the virus was infecting and killing people earlier than the country's first reported cases.,The French team looked at people admitted to the hospital with flu-like illness between December 2 and January 16 who were not ultimately diagnosed with influenza. They tested frozen samples from those patients for coronavirus.,""One sample was positive taken from a 42 year old man born in Algeria, who lived in France for many years, and worked as a fishmonger,"" the team wrote. ""His last trip was in Algeria during August 2019."" ,The man had not been to China, and one of his children had also been sick, the team reported.,""Identifying the first infected patient is of great epidemiological interest as it changes dramatically our knowledge regarding SARS-COV-2 and its spreading in the country. Moreover, the absence of a link with China and the lack of recent travel suggest that the disease was already spreading among the French population at the end of December, 2019,"" they wrote.,Europe did not start reporting cases of coronavirus until January. In Italy, the European country hit hardest by the virus, the first two cases were reported on Jan 31, in two Chinese tourists in Rome. The first known community transmission was recorded at the end of February in Codogno, northern Italy.

"Editor's Note: Michelle P. King is the director of Inclusion at Netflix and the author of The Fix: Overcome the Invisible Barriers That Are Holding Women Back at Work. The opinions expressed in this commentary are her own. ,(CNN) - As the entire world works to contain the spread of the coronavirus, the role of effective leadership has been brought into razor sharp focus. What people need now are leaders with empathy, compassion and an ability to show support — skills that women leaders tend to exhibit more than men. While it may take a global pandemic to finally acknowledge the unique talents and capabilities women leaders offer, companies shouldn't wait until there is a crisis to afford women an opportunity to lead. ,While there is insufficient data to conclude that women world leaders are managing the Covid-19 pandemic more effectively, the emerging trends are hard to ignore. New Zealand's Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern, has been widely praised for her clear, bold and supportive approach to flattening the curve. The results of her clear communication — 20 deaths in a country of nearly 5 million people — speak for themselves. Or consider German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has called for and established unity in the nation's response to the virus. Taiwan and Norway's national responses to this crisis have also proved to be effective to date, and they all have one thing in common — women leaders. ,It's a trend we've seen before. The 2008 financial crash and resulting crisis was a result of irresponsible risk taking that ultimately came down to leadership and organizational priorities. Research examining risk-taking behavior finds that men are more prone to taking higher risks. Increased collective risk-taking behavior contributed to the crisis, which was an outcome of male-dominated workplaces that valued individual achievement and competition rather than collective well-being. Subsequent research found that women tend to adopt a more relational approach to leadership, which is more effective in a crisis compared to the more traditional command-and-control style of leadership typically adopted by men. Overall, women leaders adopt a relational style when leading through a crisis, which is highly effective as they focus on building trust, alleviating fears and managing the crisis at hand. ,These lessons extend beyond crisis situations and into the everyday modern workplace. Research has consistently found women tend to adopt a more transformational leadership style, which includes demonstrating compassion, care, concern, respect and equality. In contrast, men have a more transactional approach, which includes a more task-focused, achievement-oriented and directive style of management. ,But despite having demonstrated a more effective leadership style, women are put forward for fewer leadership positions and the roles they are given tend to be riskier. It's a phenomenon known as the ""glass cliff."" One of the key reasons for this is that risky roles are often considered a good fit for women, even though the chances of failure are higher. The underlying assumption is that women can manage difficult situations because they know how to assume the caretaker role and manage a lack of social support. In other words, women are used to not being set up for success and having to make the best of it. Because women have less access to leadership opportunities, these risky leadership roles are hard to turn down.,The better leadership opportunities, meanwhile, are reserved for men — something researchers refer to as the ""glass cushion."" Because men make up most of the leadership positions in organizations, they have access to a wide range of informal (predominantly male) networks, mentors and sponsors who support them. This social support protects men from riskier positions, and, more importantly, provides men with access to leadership opportunities with a higher chance of success. While women leaders may be highly effective during a crisis, workplaces shouldn't wait until they are failing to invite women to lead. Having more women in leadership positions is likely to prevent failure from happening in the first place. ,Covid-19, its economic fallout and technological shifts to the workforce are huge challenges we all face. We don't need to keep relying on one style of leadership to see us through unprecedented crises or everyday challenges. If we want to survive — and ultimately thrive — in the new normal, we should make sure women leaders are at the table.,© 2019 Cable News Network. Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.

""But I was surprised to see there are many other interesting structures that are not (quite as) well known."",Chandigarh was designed in the 1950s as Punjab's new state capital following the partition.

""From an urbanist point of view, the impression is that the districts are more like islands separated one from another by traffic-jammed roads."",While Le Corbusier was the project's ""starchitect,"" Conte notes that most of the buildings were the result of a collaboration between the Western team hired to realize Chandigarh, and a group of Indian architects and urbanists.

"Editor's Note: Brad Meltzer and Josh Mensch are the bestselling authors of The Lincoln Conspiracy: The Secret Plot to Kill America's 16th President—And Why It Failed, which is now available in bookstores everywhere. The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the authors; view more opinion articles on CNN.,(CNN) - At a time of national crisis, the public craves leadership. With the country politically divided and facing a deadly pandemic with no clear end in sight, the need for competence and vision at the highest levels has never been more essential. Our future depends on it.,At his recent town hall, President Donald Trump said that the press treats him even worse than Abraham Lincoln. ""I am greeted with a hostile press the likes of which no president has ever seen,"" Trump said during a Fox News town hall on Sunday night. ""The closest would be that gentleman right up there,"" he added, pointing to the statue of Lincoln. ""They always said nobody got treated worse than Lincoln. I believe I am treated worse."",History challenges this opinion and in fact, Lincoln's character was demonstrated in his response to vitriol from his rivals. He was humble, self-deprecating, and gracious to those who attacked him. He didn't insult his opponents; he embraced them. He insisted he was president for all Americans, even at a time of division. ,Perhaps no president in American history faced more fury at a time of crisis than Abraham Lincoln. When he was elected in November 1860, the country was deeply divided over the issue of slavery. We may think our elections now are contentious, but they can't compare to Lincoln's. From the moment he was nominated, it got personal, one paper writing that ""Lincoln is the leanest, lankest, most ungainly mass of legs, arms, and hatchet-face ever strung upon a single frame. He has most unwarrantably abused the privilege which all politicians have of being ugly."" It only got worse.,Two weeks before the election, the Montgomery Weekly Mail declared: ""Let the South be the home of the white man, proud of his race, and proud of his race's superiority! . . . If Lincoln and his free n***er outrider are elected, we must not submit."" This wasn't just the language of political disagreement; it was the language of outright revolt. Lincoln didn't just get dragged in the press, he was the Southerners' mortal enemy. ,Only three days after his election, South Carolina declared Lincoln's victory a ""hostile act"" and began taking steps to secede from the Union. More southern states soon followed. Then the hate mail started. ""There were threats of hanging him, burning him, decapitating him, flogging him,"" a Lincoln colleague reported.  ,These weren't just angry words. In fact, a southern secret society was planning to assassinate Lincoln before he could take the oath of office. For two years, we've been researching this plot for our book, ""The Lincoln Conspiracy."" Lincoln had earlier shrugged off most of his death threats, but during his inaugural rail journey from Illinois to Washington, DC, he learned that a pro-slavery group in Baltimore planned to kill him on his way to the capital.,Lincoln ultimately evaded the assassins in Baltimore and arrived safely in Washington, DC. But even then, the press roasted him, The Charleston Mercury calling him ""cowardly and undignified"" for running from his own killers.  ,Several days later, with national tension at an all-time high, Lincoln delivered his first inaugural address. By then, he had firsthand experience of the anger and division in the country. He'd been demonized and insulted. He'd received death threats and thwarted an assassination plot.,Yet in Lincoln's inaugural speech, he showed no spite. In the face of discord and rage, his speech was a plea for common American purpose. In the last lines, he said: ""We are not enemies, but friends. Though passion may have strained it must not break our bonds of affection. The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.""   ,Those words have echoed through the ages. They also set a tone and vision for Lincoln's presidency -- one that carried him through America's greatest crisis -- despite how anyone in the press treated him.,To be clear, Lincoln's conciliatory tone didn't mean he lacked firm beliefs.  As southern states seceded, he faced enormous pressure to compromise on slavery in order to avert war. But on the most important question of whether slavery could spread to new territories joining the Union, Lincoln was inflexible. He had run for president on a platform that slavery must not spread, and he wouldn't budge.,This particular mix of qualities -- humble and gracious, but stubborn on principle -- were an early indication of Lincoln's unique leadership.,In the end, Lincoln would always take the side of hope over hatred. He would always appeal to the best in Americans, not the worst. And he did so without conceding his principles. Amidst the darkness of war, Lincoln overcame enormous opposition and reached for the light. On January 1, 1863, he signed the Emancipation Proclamation: the first monumental step to abolish slavery in America. In so doing, he would make himself a target for assassins once again.,Honesty. Humility. Selflessness. During a time of hatred and rage, Lincoln took the side of the better angels. Under his leadership, America didn't just survive the Civil War -- it became a better nation through the struggle.,Today as we face our own crisis at a time of division -- and with yet another contentious election on the horizon -- Trump should stop comparing his press coverage to Lincoln's, and instead start modeling Lincoln's leadership.,© 2019 Cable News Network.

"New York  (CNN Business) - President Donald Trump has picked the worst possible time to relaunch his trade battle with China. ,The coronavirus pandemic is crushing the US and global economies. Unemployment is soaring. GDP is collapsing at an unprecedented pace. Corporate profits are plunging. Manufacturing is contracting.,Yet Trump could amplify that financial pain by attempting to use tariffs or other sanctions to punish China for its role in the health crisis. Economists warn that such a strategy could badly backfire, potentially turning what is now a deep recession into a full-blown depression. ,""This is pure folly. It's exactly what the US economy doesn't need,"" Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM, told CNN Business.  ,Wall Street is not happy about the return of Tariff Man, as Trump calls himself. ,The Dow tumbled 622 points, or 2.6%, on Friday on concerns about renewed US-China tensions. US markets retreated again Monday after US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said over the weekend there is ""enormous evidence"" that the virus originated in a laboratory in Wuhan.  Trump said tariffs would be the ""ultimate punishment"" for China.,'Entirely bad idea',Recall that the Great Depression was worsened by a global trade war. In 1930, Congress passed the Smoot-Hawley Act, which imposed tariffs on all countries that shipped goods to America. Other countries retaliated with their own tariffs on US-made products.   ,Repeating that mistake might deepen the ongoing downturn, as new trade tensions could cause last year's US-China trade agreement to implode. Higher tariffs -- or merely threats of them -- could amplify the uncertainty facing companies around the world. And it will add pressure to complex global supply chains. ,""A Smoot-Hawley sequel is an entirely bad idea,"" Brusuelas said. ,Keep in mind that US tariffs on China don't directly punish China -- US businesses and households pay the cost of those taxes, not Beijing.  ,The timing of the renewed trade tensions is highly unusual.  ,In the past, the argument for taking the fight to China was that the United States economy was strong enough to withstand a trade war. Yet talk of tariffs now comes as even Trump's own economic advisers warn of 20% unemployment and a 40% collapse in GDP. In other words, the US economy is extremely vulnerable.  ,Wall Street had been betting on a swift recovery from the recession. That optimism had lifted the S&P 500 about 30% above its March 23 low, at least before Friday's tumble. ,New tariffs would clearly cast doubt on that assumption, according to Deepak Puri, CIO Americas at Deutsche Bank Wealth Management. ""Discussions around new tariffs would be bad news, for both financial markets and the economy,"" Puri wrote in an email. ,Could Trump cancel US debt owed to China?,Multiple Trump administration sources told CNN this week that there is an appetite to use various tools against China, the most alarming of which is the idea of retaliating against China by canceling US debt owed to Beijing, as first reported in The Washington Post. ,China owns $1.1 trillion of US Treasuries, according to the Treasury Department, making this an enticing idea for China hawks. And it could be intriguing to Trump, who has called himself the King of Debt.  ,For instance, Republican Senator Marsha Blackburn told Fox News Radio this week the United States should consider waiving interest payments to China because of the economic cost of the pandemic. ""I think that that's an idea that is worthy of exploration looking forward,"" she said.  ,Market chaos,Such a move would be highly destabilizing, as it would constitute a default on US debt, analysts say. That in turn could force ratings firms to downgrade the United States' own credit rating, undermining the widely-held view that US Treasuries are the safest assets in the world, where they serve as a benchmark for pricing on everything from mortgages to junk bonds.  ,""Collecting reparations"" through China's Treasury holdings ""would undermine financial markets"" and be ""legally questionable,"" analysts at consulting firm Eurasia Group wrote in a note to clients Thursday. The firm said such a move is ""extremely unlikely.""  ,Chris Krueger, analyst at Washington Research Group, agrees. ""We don't think this will happen and it is likely to see serious pushback, BUT we are in totally uncharted waters,"" Krueger wrote in a note to clients.  ,Brusuelas, the RSM economist, warned that canceling US debt held by China would ""cause global financial markets to come to a screeching halt"" and worsen the economic crisis.  ,""If such a thing were to ever be attempted it would create the conditions for a global depression,"" Brusuelas said. ,Trump prefers tariffs,Trump's economic advisers have been trying to shoot down this idea.  ,""The full faith and credit of US debt obligations is sacrosanct. Period. Full stop,"" White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told Reuters, adding that the Washington Post article is ""completely wrong."" ,Even Trump sounds cautious about such a radical strategy. Asked if he would consider having the United States not pay its debt obligations to China, Trump expressed concern about undermining the US dollar. ,""When you start playing that game, you're really hurting the sanctity, the importance of the greatest currency on Earth,"" Trump said Thursday. ""That's a rough game."" ,Yet he didn't back down from the idea of punishing China through alternate  methods that could also hurt the economy. ""We can do it in other ways. We can do it with tariffs,"" Trump said.  ,In other words, Tariff Man is winning out over King of Debt. Either way, the economy could be the big loser.  ,© 2019 Cable News Network.

"(CNN) - A nationalist tabloid controlled by the Chinese Communist Party has dismissed claims by the Trump administration that the novel coronavirus originated from a laboratory, as the war of words over the pandemic escalates between Washington and Beijing.,US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Sunday in an interview with ABC that there was ""enormous evidence"" Covid-19 originated in a laboratory in the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the outbreak was first detected last December. He did not provide details to support the claim.,Responding to Pompeo's comments, China's state owned Global Times newspaper said in an editorial Monday that the former CIA director had ""stunned the world with groundless accusations."" ,""Since Pompeo said his claims are supported by 'enormous evidence,' then he should present this so-called evidence to the world, and especially to the American public who he continually tries to fool,"" the editorial said.,""The truth is that Pompeo does not have any evidence, and during Sunday's interview, he was bluffing."",CNN reached out to China's foreign ministry for comment on Pompeo's claims, but received no response. The country is in the middle of a five-day holiday that runs through Tuesday.,Scientists around the world have condemned conspiracy theories suggesting that Covid-19 does not have a natural origin, pointing to studies that suggest it originated in wildlife.,China has faced criticism at home and abroad over its handling of the virus, especially during the initial outbreak. It was accused of silencing whistle-blowers and delaying in informing the public about the severity of the crisis.,But critics allege Washington has ramped up efforts to blame China for the global spread of the virus as it faces growing criticism at home for its own handling of the pandemic. To date, the US has recorded more than 1.1 million cases and at least 67,000 Covid-19 related deaths.,Beijing has hit back with its own propaganda efforts, accusing the US of shifting blame and brushing aside accusations of a deliberate coverup in the critical early stages.,Last Tuesday, Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang accused ""American politicians"" of telling lies about the pandemic.,""They have only one objective: to try to shirk responsibility for their own epidemic and prevention and control measures and divert public attention,"" he said.,On April 30, China's state-run news agency Xinhua posted an animated video featuring Lego-like figures that mocked the US response to the pandemic. It has been viewed for 1.9 million times on Twitter.,On Monday, the Global Times editorial accused the White House of continuing to ""engage in unprecedented propaganda warfare while trying to impede global efforts in fighting the Covid-19 pandemic."",""As the US presidential election campaigns are underway, the Trump administration has implemented a strategy designed to divert attention from the incompetence it has displayed in fighting the pandemic. It is clear that their goal is to blame China for the pandemic by pinpointing the country as the source of Covid-19,"" it said. ,Origins of the virus,The coronavirus has infected more than 3.5 million people worldwide, with at least 247,000 dead. The US accounts for nearly a third of the global confirmed cases and more than one fourth of the deaths.,Pompeo's remarks followed US President Donald Trump's claims on Thursday that he had seen evidence that gave him a ""high degree of confidence"" the virus originated in a laboratory in Wuhan. Trump declined to provide details to back up his assertion.,Scientists in China and the West have pointed to research indicating that the virus is likely to have originated in bats and jumped to humans from an intermediate host -- just like its cousin that caused the SARS epidemic in 2002 and 2003.,The Office of the Director of National Intelligence also said in a statement Thursday that the ""Intelligence Community also concurs with the wide scientific consensus that the Covid-19 virus was not man-made or genetically modified."",Asked Sunday about that conclusion, Pompeo said he has ""no reason to disbelieve"" the intelligence community, despite comments earlier in the same interview that ""the best experts so far seem to think it was man-made. I have no reason to disbelieve that at this point."",Chinese officials and state media have repeatedly stressed that there has been no conclusion on the exact origin of the virus, while pushing their own unfounded claims alleging it did not originate in China. In March, Zhao Lijian, a spokesperson of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, promoted a conspiracy theory on Twitter that the virus had originated in the US and was brought to China by the US military.,The ire of Beijing,So far, Chinese officials and state media have largely avoided directly naming Trump in its coverage of the spat. Instead, much of Beijing's ire has been directed at Pompeo -- and former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, who does not hold any current position in the administration.,Last week, the state-run broadcaster CGTN accused Pompeo of turning ""his back on humanity by spreading a political virus."" The Chinese Communist Party's official mouthpiece, the People's Daily, also said in an editorial that Pompeo's rhetoric will deliver the US a ""colossal moral deficit."",On Monday, the Global Times said Pompeo was ""indulging in a solo performance that has failed to adhere to the professional standards expected for a chief diplomat,"" and accused him of losing ""his moral compass."",State media also bristled at Bannon after he criticized China's handling of the outbreak in an interview with CNBC on Thursday and suggested Beijing should be held financially responsible for the pandemic.,On Sunday night, state broadcaster CCTV aired a commentary during its flagship evening newscast that lashed out at Bannon, calling him a ""stubborn anti-China figure"" with ""zero moral integrity."",© 2019 Cable News Network.

"Washington  (CNN) - The Chinese government intentionally concealed the severity of the coronavirus from the international community while it stockpiled imports and decreased exports, a Department of Homeland Security report found, according to two administration officials familiar with the report.,""China likely cut its exports of medical supplies prior to its January WHO (World Health Organization) notification that COVID-19 is a contagion,"" the report reads, according to one source. A second source confirmed the authenticity of the document to CNN on Monday.,The report, which assessed export and import data earlier this year, was circulated within the federal government on Friday, the source said. ABC first reported its existence.,Earlier Sunday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo stepped up administration claims that China mounted efforts to hide the extent of the coronavirus spread, including concealing the severity while stockpiling medical supplies.,""You've got the facts just about right,"" Pompeo told ABC's ""This Week"" when asked if China intentionally stockpiled medical supplies in early January while it concealed the severity of Covid-19. ""We can confirm that the Chinese Communist Party did all that it could to make sure that the world didn't learn in a timely fashion about what was taking place."",Pompeo's comments come as the Trump administration is formulating a long-term plan to punish China on multiple fronts for the coronavirus pandemic, injecting a rancorous new element into a critical relationship already on a steep downward slide.,Multiple sources inside the administration say that there is an appetite to use various tools, including sanctions, canceling US debt obligations and drawing up new trade policies, to make clear to China, and to everyone else, where they feel the responsibility lies.,While there are serious questions about China's transparency, the Trump administration has escalated its effort to blame China for the global spread of the virus as criticism of its own handling of the pandemic has increased. President Donald Trump repeatedly downplayed the threat from the novel coronavirus and suggested it would not be a problem for the US at a time when it was clearly already spreading around the world. Trump also repeatedly showered Chinese President Xi Jinping with praise for his management of the crisis as he sought to safeguard a trade deal with the Chinese.,The DHS assessment also says, ""in its communications, China intentionally concealed its trade activity by publicly denying it has ever imposed an export ban on masks and other medical supplies,"" according to the source. ,The findings were assessed at ""moderate confidence,"" the source told CNN, pointing out that the report does not conclude whether the actions of the Chinese government were nefarious. It is reasonable to conclude that based on the outbreak, before it was declared pandemic, China would recognize key measurements in determining requirements for the need of personal protective equipment, the source said. ,The US needs ""to be mindful about, 'what do you do about it?'"" the source noted. ""Is this a trigger that propels industry here? Will there be enough in the stockpile going forward?"" the source asked. ,China has access to a wide array of raw materials necessary in establishing a production line of goods needed in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, said the source, whether it's surgical gowns, masks or goggles.,""They have a robust manufacturing capability and workforce that can quickly ramp up manufacturing,"" the source said. ,On Sunday, Pompeo mentioned that some efforts that the Chinese Communist Party took were not seen, but others were public such as not allowing US medical professionals into labs in Wuhan, the city where the virus originated, and silencing scientists.,""President Trump is very clear, we're gonna hold those responsible accountable and we'll do so on a timeline that is our own,"" Pompeo said.,Trump administration officials have been pushing the US intelligence community to determine the exact origins of the coronavirus outbreak in pursuit of an unproven theory that the pandemic started because of a laboratory accident in China, multiple sources told CNN. The President on Thursday contradicted the intelligence community and claimed he has seen evidence that gives him a ""high degree of confidence"" Covid-19 originated in a laboratory in Wuhan, China, but declined to provide details to back up his assertion. ,Asked about the belief expressed by Trump and if he had seen evidence backing that claim, Pompeo said, ""There's enormous evidence that that's where this began."",""We've said from the beginning that this was a virus that originated in Wuhan, China. We took a lot of grief for that from the outside, but I think the whole world can see now,"" he said. He later added, ""there is a significant amount of evidence that this came from that laboratory in Wuhan."" ,The Office of the Director of National Intelligence said in a statement Thursday that the ""Intelligence Community also concurs with the wide scientific consensus that the COVID-19 virus was not manmade or genetically modified."" ,Asked Sunday about that conclusion, Pompeo said he agreed with it. Pompeo said that he has ""no reason to disbelieve"" the intelligence community, adding, ""I've seen their analysis. I've seen the summary that you saw that was released publicly. I have no reason to doubt that that is accurate."",Though Pompeo also echoed Trump's statement last week that he has seen evidence linking the outbreak to the Wuhan lab, which contradicted the statement from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. That statement said US intelligence was ""rigorously"" examining whether the outbreak was ""through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan."",Pompeo added that China ""behaved like authoritarian regimes do, attempted to conceal and hide and confused and employed the World Health Organization as a tool to do the same."",""These are the kinds of things that have presented this enormous crisis and enormous loss of life and tremendous economic loss all across the globe,"" he said. ""The Australians agree with that, you hear the Europeans beginning to say the same thing, and I think the whole world is united understanding that China brought this virus to the world."",CNN reported last month that the US government was looking into the theory that the virus originated in the lab but hadn't yet been able to corroborate it. In April, Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the weight of evidence suggests the virus was of natural origin.,Asked about whether China intentionally released the virus or if it was an accident, Pompeo refused to give an opinion.,""I don't have anything to say about that. I think there's a lot to know, but I can say this. We've done our best to try and answer all of those questions. We tried to get a team in there, the WHO (World Health Organization) tried to get a team in there, and they have failed. No one's been allowed to go into this lab or any of the other laboratories...this is an ongoing challenge. We still need to get in there. We still don't have the virus samples we need."",The US-China clash is brewing amid growing suspicion inside the administration over China's rising strategic challenge and fury that the virus destroyed an economy seen as Trump's passport to a second term.,There are serious questions to be addressed about China's transparency in the early days of the outbreak in Wuhan and whether its autocratic system fostered an attempt to cover it up. The United States is not the only nation that wants answers amid a pandemic that has devastated the global economy and cost hundreds of thousands of lives.,In response to building pressure, China has launched a propaganda effort to distract from its own culpability, including blaming US soldiers for importing the pathogen in remarks that infuriated Trump. On Tuesday, Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang accused ""American politicians"" of telling barefaced lies about the pandemic.,""They have only one objective: to try to shirk responsibility for their own epidemic and prevention and control measures and divert public attention,"" he said.,On Wednesday, China's state-run news agency Xinhua posted an animated video mocking the US response to the coronavirus pandemic as it described China's response in a flattering way.,© 2019 Cable News Network.

"Washington  (CNN) - With the general election just six months away, and the global economy in shambles because of the coronavirus, there is increasing urgency inside the White House and among President Donald Trump's Republican allies to blame China over its failure to stem the spread of the disease early on. ,Now, there's an effort underway to enlist foreign allies to do the same.,In recent weeks, Trump, along with several administration officials including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow, have spoken to dozens of foreign allies about ways to collectively address what the White House says was China's intentional effort to conceal the severity of the outbreak, according to two people with knowledge of the discussions.,The President himself has scaled up his conversations with foreign counterparts over the past three weeks, and has raised China with dozens of foreign leaders, one person familiar with those conversations said. While many traditional US allies remain wary of ratcheting up tensions with China, in speaking with Trump, some European leaders have expressed concern at how China handled the crisis, according to the person.,Among the retaliatory options being discussed inside the White House are imposing additional tariffs on Chinese products, stripping China of its sovereign immunity, and cracking down further on Chinese telecommunication companies, the people said. Officials emphasized that there is no imminent action expected.,Among those pushing the President to take a harder line is Jared Kushner, Trump's top adviser and son-in-law. According to three people familiar with his thinking, Kushner believes that one way to energize the President's political base is by blasting China over its failure to stem the spread of the disease early on. ,""The more you put this on China, the less you can say that we were slow on mobilizing,"" one person close to the White House said.,Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who is known to advocate for closer economic ties with Beijing and is viewed as far less hawkish than some of the President's top China advisers, has ""started to come around"" on taking a tougher stance on China, according to two people familiar with his views. These people caution however that Mnuchin remains reluctant to take any actions that might damage the initial Phase One trade deal the Trump administration agreed to with China last year.,Sources who spoke to CNN added that there has been a concerted effort to isolate trade discussions from the current political tensions so as not to damage the work that's been done. Even in private, administration officials have been careful not to bash China for non-performance on agriculture purchases, which observers say is nowhere near the peak commitment levels they had agreed to, particularly where soybeans are concerned. ,China has taken some action with regard to their trade deal commitments on intellectual property, but overall it has been an uneven record on Phase One, these people said, adding that neither side has even broached the subject of Phase Two trade talks.,Trump still wary of Xi ,While Trump has ramped up his rhetoric against China recently, he has been careful not to criticize Chinese President Xi Jinping directly, as he is wary of damaging a personal relationship. In conversations with several hawkish Senate Republicans who have encouraged Trump to turn his rhetoric on China into action, Trump has at times wavered, one Senate GOP source said.,""He still has a soft spot for Xi,"" the source said.,A source close to the White House put it another way: ""He's scared s***less. Xi scares him."" ,Just as at other turns in his trade war with China, some of Trump's business friends have warned him that taking action against China could hurt the US stock market, two sources close to the White House told CNN. ,Still, there are reasons it might make sense politically for Trump to target China. A Pew Research poll last month showed that two-thirds of Americans have an unfavorable view of China. That data was bolstered by internal polling conducted by the Republican National Committee that showed similarly negative views on China among voters in several key battleground states, a source familiar with the polling said.,The White House and Treasury Department didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The State Department declined to comment.,On Sunday, Trump publicly acknowledged that he believes the outbreak, while covered up by China, was the result of a ""mistake."", ,""My opinion is they made a mistake. They tried to cover it, they tried to put it out. It's like a fire,"" Trump said in an interview with Fox News. ""You know, it's really like trying to put out a fire. They couldn't put out the fire."",The President added that his administration was putting together a report on the outbreak that will be ""very conclusive."",Trump referenced the contentious relationship between the two nations last Thursday, when he told reporters at the White House that China does not want to see him get reelected because the US is ""getting billions"" from the country thanks to their trade deal, a comment that fails to address the negative impact the trade deal has had on farmers and the broader US economy due to higher tariffs.,When asked if China's withholding information about the coronavirus was related to undermining his reelection, Trump said that ""China would like to see sleepy Joe Biden -- they would take this country for a ride like you've never seen before."",Last week, in a highly unusual move, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence released a statement saying that the US is trying to determine whether coronavirus may have escaped from a laboratory in the city of Wuhan. The statement said that the intelligence agencies agree, with broad scientific consensus, that Covid-19 was not manmade or genetically modified. It added that it would continue to evaluate emerging information and intelligence to determine whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at the lab in Wuhan.,Pompeo offered a bit more of a definitive assessment on Sunday, telling ABC News that there is ""enormous evidence"" that coronavirus originated in a laboratory, while agreeing with the intelligence community's assessment that it doesn't appear to have been manmade or genetically modified.,© 2019 Cable News Network.

"(CNN) - President Donald Trump's pick to be director of national intelligence, Texas GOP Rep. John Ratcliffe, is likely to face pointed questions Tuesday in the Senate over his ties to the President and questions about his resume and qualifications.,Ratcliffe is appearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee after he was selected by the President a second time to be the nation's spy chief. Ratcliffe withdrew from consideration when he was first tapped for the role last summer amid concerns from even some Republicans about exaggerations to his national security resume, but Trump picked him again in February for the role.,Ratcliffe appears to have the support he needs from Republicans who were skeptical the first time he was picked, but Democrats are sure to press him on his ability to be independent from Trump when the President has expressed an open distrust of the intelligence community and refused to agree with the assessment on Russian election interference.,Ratcliffe's confirmation hearing is the first Senate hearing being held since the Senate reconvened this week in a new, socially distant world at the US Capitol. The hearing will be closed to the public, and the number of Senate aides and reporters will be curtailed. Senators are expected to rotate into the hearing in small groups to limit the number in the room at one time.,The hearing comes amid questions about Trump's claims of intelligence on the origins of the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, China, and the removal of top intelligence officials earlier this year, including former intelligence community inspector general Michael Atkinson and then-acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire.,Ratcliffe would be replacing US Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell, a fierce loyalist to the President who was named acting director of national intelligence in February following Maguire's ouster. Grenell has butted heads with Congress since taking over the role.,Ratcliffe is not particularly close to Trump, and they did not meet on-on-one until last year, according to a source close to the confirmation process. Ratcliffe was, however, a vocal defender of the President during the impeachment proceedings, a performance Trump raved about before picking him a second time.,Democrats say they will press Ratcliffe on the politicization of the intelligence community and his willingness to provide intelligence to the President that he doesn't want to hear. They're also likely to delve into apparent exaggerations to Ratcliffe's resume prosecuting terrorism cases in the US Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Texas, which emerged following his selection last year.,""I've got serious questions [about] a whole list of items,"" Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the intelligence panel, told CNN on Monday, saying he met with Ratcliffe on Friday.,The Justice Department provided the committee with a document stating that Ratcliffe was assigned 34 cases labeled terrorism or national security critical infrastructure, according to the source close to the confirmation process. But a Democratic source close to the committee said the document didn't include specific cases or show that Ratcliffe had tried any of the cases included.,Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr, a North Carolina Republican who was cool to Ratcliffe's nomination last year, said after Ratcliffe was nominated a second time this year that he would support the pick. And Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine said in a statement last week that she was backing Ratcliffe after meeting with him, saying he had the ""experience to meet the statutory standard to fill the position."",The director of national intelligence leads the 17 agencies that make up the intelligence community. The role and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence were created in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.,Ratcliffe has been prepping for Tuesday's confirmation hearing at ODNI and has met with agency heads to get their perspective.,There are a host of issues Ratcliffe is likely to field questions about, from Russian election interference to the intelligence on the coronavirus outbreak to the restricting of the nation's intelligence agencies and the office he would lead if confirmed.,Trump still has refused to agree with the intelligence community's 2017 assessment that Russia interfered in the US election in 2016 -- and tried to help Trump win. While Ratcliffe has said he believes Russia interfered in the 2016 election, it's not clear how he will address the specific finding that the Russians favored Trump.,Trump's recent touting of intelligence on the exact origins of the coronavirus in China -- as well as his attempt to rebut press reports about when he was given intelligence on the outbreak earlier this year -- are both likely to be key topics at Tuesday's hearing.,© 2019 Cable News Network.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion articles on CNN.,(CNN) - As the pandemic rages, there is at least heroism to inspire us. Health care workers battling this virus. Truck drivers and grocers maintaining the supply lines of essentials. Volunteers delivering food to the elderly. The list goes on and on.   ,Naturally, there are also villains. Price gougers. Hate-mongers. And then there are the folks endangering lives by refusing to socially distance. How should we view this brand of villain? ,I'm not referring to people massing in protest against quarantines, arguing that a shuttered economy is worse than the virus. While concern for the poor and newly unemployed is laudable, their humanitarianism is curdled by their various political agendas. ,The rebels I refer to disobey the rules because, well, they wanna. Perhaps they don't know there's a virus going around. Maybe they do care about others, but their circle of caring doesn't include anyone they'd consider at risk. Perhaps it's tricky, understanding that massing in groups with uncovered faces might now be as dangerous as brandishing a weapon. Or maybe they're just selfish.,Comprehending their actions seems challenging, given their varied motivations. Here's what some of the prime public health flouters were saying as the virus took hold in March.,There were the religious leaders who appeared to believe no virus dared harm.  ,Megachurch pastor Rodney Howard-Browne in Florida, proclaimed, ""This Bible school is open because we're raising young revivalists, not pansies."" (Howard-Browne later moved his Easter services online because, according to his lawyer, he had received death threats for holding his earlier services. During his Easter morning broadcast, he said he was waiting for God to tell him when to reopen.),The sexton of a synagogue in Crown Heights in Brooklyn, Zalman Lipsker, who said that the synagogue, ""will be open until Moshiach [the Messiah]."" (Synagogue officials later announced it would be closed ""for a period of time.) ,Bishop Gerald Glenn, a Virginia evangelist, who held services because, ""God is larger than this dreaded virus."" Glenn has now died from Covid-19, Brooklyn's Hasidic families suffer excruciating losses and the virus rages in rural America.,There are those whose flouting, rather than God- or Constitution-given, is youth-given -- a belief in their immortality and of those who matter to them. These were the spring-break revelers and the nitwits who held furtive parties stocked with post-ironic Corona beer while the virus proves more virulent among the young than predicted.  ,And then there are the ""Don't Tread On Me"" survivalists, convinced the government is confiscating constitutional rights through pandemic hoaxes, channeling Benjamin Franklin with statements of ""If you would trade liberty for security, you deserve neither,"" and, in a move that would pass for hilarious absurdity in happier times, comparing themselves favorably to civil rights activist Rosa Parks.  ,Some of these partyers and religious leaders may now be taking social distancing more seriously than when they first disavowed it. But it's important to understand that religious fundamentalists weren't defying government rules because they want to become sacrificial lambs.,Instead, it's about wanting to congregate in congregations. Idaho revolutionaries aren't revolting because the government conspires against their constitutional right to a speedy trial. It's the right to assemble. And the invincible youth weren't defying rules against toilet-papering statues. It's defying a ban against hanging with friends and hooking up and puking their guts out after beer pong marathons.  ,Strip away the details and it's all the same. Congregating. Assembling. Partying. It's primate sociality.  ,We primates are the most social species in the animal kingdom. Hunter-gatherers spend their evenings gossiping around the fire; other primates show the equivalent. Record the vocalizations of the members of a group of baboons, splice things to make it sound like two individuals are fighting and play it from a speaker in the bushes, and everyone stops what they're doing to listen.,Our sociality comforts us. We turn to loved ones after trauma, and doing so lessens the hormonal stress response. After baboons have a close call with a lion, everyone sits, grooming -- and doing so lessens that same stress response. Put us primates in solitary confinement and we unravel. ,Sociality pays off. Chimps learn to make tools through social observation, monkeys have trouble learning transitivity with physical objects (""If A is bigger B and B is bigger than C, then A is bigger than C""), but master social transitivity (""If A defeats B and B defeats C, then A defeats C"").,While a solitary altruist will be outcompeted by a solitary backstabber, a group of the former triumphs over a group of the latter, a means for the evolution of cooperation. And humans, with our lousy speed, strength and sensory acuity, avoided extinction by working in groups.,Our primate brains are sculpted by sociality. One brain region specializes in recognizing faces. Another categorizes people by sex, age, race and status cues, deciding, ""Is this an Us or a Them?"" in a fraction of a second. If a monkey lives in a bigger social group, his frontal cortex grows bigger.,We have evolved to bicker, eavesdrop, joust, tryst, compete, aid and backstab, and we have the brains to prove it. No wonder then that the pixilated face of a friend on Zoom, or talking through a face mask with someone across the street, isn't the next logical step in social evolution. We are being asked to go against our primate essence.,This is not to excuse those who won't keep their distance, but to scientifically explain the sin while trying not to boil in fury at the sinner. And maybe even to understand how to change their primate minds. ,© 2019 Cable News Network. Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. All Rights Reserved."
"(CNN) - The office of former President Barack Obama in a March letter privately assailed a congressional investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son's work at a Ukrainian energy company, calling it an attempt ""to shift the blame for Russian interference in the 2016 election to Ukraine."",Writing to the National Archives and Records Administration -- which maintains presidential records -- Obama's office specifically said that a request from Republican Sens. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Chuck Grassley of Iowa seeking administration documents related to Ukraine was improper. The letter was first reported by BuzzFeed.,""The request for early release of presidential records in order to give credence to a Russian disinformation campaign -- one that has already been thoroughly investigated by a bipartisan congressional committee -- is without precedent,"" said the letter signed by Obama's records representative and dated March 13.,Obama's office went on to write that it will release the requested records but only ""in the interest of countering the misinformation campaign underlying this request."",""In doing so, we emphasize that abuse of the special access process strikes at the heart of presidential confidentiality interests and undermines the statutory framework and norms that govern access to presidential records,"" the letter concluded.,The November request from Johnson and Grassley came as part of GOP effort to obtain a host of records from government agencies related to the Bidens, the Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma and uncorroborated allegations about Ukrainian interference in the 2016 US election. ,While Republicans have publicly insist their efforts have nothing to do with Biden's current presidential campaign, they have used their powers in the Senate to look into a series of matters that they believe could shine negative light on the former vice president -- and help President Donald Trump.,Trump and his allies have repeatedly made unfounded and false claims to allege that the Bidens acted corruptly in Ukraine.,The President was impeached by the House of Representatives in December 2019 following a sprawling three-month Democratic investigation into allegations that the he pressured Ukraine to investigate the former vice president while withholding US security assistance and a White House meeting. ,Biden, who was surging in the Democratic primary race in early March as Republicans sharpened their investigation into him and his son, has since become the presumptive Democratic nominee for president. ,© 2019 Cable News Network.

At a time when partisanship still runs rampant, despite a pandemic, Kentucky's leaders have found a way to come to a bipartisan agreement on how to administer the upcoming primary on June 23. That agreement -- which expands vote-by-mail for all voters, permits in-person voting for those who need it, and allows the state to begin the process of cleaning up the voter rolls -- pales in comparison to the debacle in Wisconsin, where partisan bickering and court decisions that fell along ideological lines led voters to face an unfathomable choice between their health and their fundamental right to vote.,Officials in other states should copy Kentucky's lead. Senator Mitch McConnell should look to his own backyard to see how working across the aisle can actually produce positive results for the people. Maybe if McConnell emulated his state's leaders—and learned how to work in a bipartisan manner -- he would not be so unpopular.,The Kentucky deal gives something to each side, but most importantly, it prioritizes the protection of voters. Democratic Governor Andy Beshear and Republican Secretary of State Michael G. Adams -- who under state law can jointly alter the ""manner"" of an election during a state of emergency -- have changed Kentucky's strict election rules substantially to make it easier to vote. Although the agreement applies only to the June 23 primary, they should expand it to November and beyond.,Kentucky is one of 16 states that normally requires an excuse to vote absentee, but the agreement allows any voter to claim a ""medical emergency"" because of the coronavirus. That's common sense: We are all suffering from a medical emergency right now, even if we have not personally contracted the virus. ,The state will create an online portal for voters to request an absentee ballot. That will ease the process on voters and minimize the amount of paper requests that county clerks must process, though voters can still request an absentee ballot through the normal means. Absentee ballots must be postmarked by Election Day but can arrive up to four days later, ensuring that voters are not disenfranchised because of delays within the postal service. The state will trace every absentee ballot, minimizing the concern of fraud. There is virtually no fraud in our elections, including through vote-by-mail, but ballot tracing will hopefully make people feel even more secure about the process.,Voters can still vote in person during two weeks of early voting -- which the state does not normally have -- as well as on Election Day, and they can even make an appointment to do so in an effort to avoid crowds, though they cannot be turned away for not having an appointment. Polling places must scrupulously follow the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines on social distancing and sanitary practices. Counties can use vote centers and drive-through voting. The goal is to minimize direct contact between poll workers and voters as much as possible.,In addition, the state will mail a postcard to every voter in the state to notify them of these procedures, which will include the URL to request an absentee ballot (the State Board of Elections is still finalizing the portal). If the postcards are returned as undeliverable, then the state will use that fact in the first step of a process to clean up the voter rolls, though federal and state law forbids the state from purging any voters unless the person both fails to respond to an additional mailed notice and then fails to vote in two subsequent November federal elections.,The deal therefore maximizes the goals of both Democrats and Republicans: It makes it much easier to participate in the election during a pandemic by expanding vote-by-mail. It also prioritizes security measures within the new procedures, and allows the state to start the process of cleaning up the voter rolls. This is a model for the rest of the country to consider.,To be sure, it would better for the state to mail every voter an absentee ballot automatically without the voter needing to request one, as occurs in five other states, but Kentucky Secretary of State Adams refused to do so given his concerns, overblown as they may be, about bloated voter rolls. This next best solution -- allowing any voter to request an absentee ballot through a secure online portal -- is a good compromise. In addition, voter purges must be done with care, lest valid voters lose their right to vote, especially given that voter purges often harm minorities the most.,None of this progress is to suggest that partisanship no longer exists in Kentucky. Republicans are aghast that Beshear vetoed a new abortion bill and criticized his statement that signing it would itself be divisive. Republican Attorney General Daniel Cameron has joined a lawsuit against Beshear to challenge his executive order that restricts travel out of the state. Democrats, for their part, were justifiably apoplectic that, during a pandemic, Republicans pushed through a new photo ID requirement for voting -- though that bill does not go into effect until the November election.,But on the vitally important issue of how to ensure our elections will proceed during a pandemic, Kentucky's leaders from both sides worked together with one goal in mind: how to best protect voters. It's a lesson that other states should take to heart.,© 2019 Cable News Network. Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. All Rights Reserved."

It will brighten your inbox every Saturday morning.,(CNN) - An avid marathon runner in New Jersey laced up his shoes and set out to run 20.20 miles last weekend weekend -- but his mission was different this time.,Patrick Rodio, 47, wasn't aiming to set a personal record or come in first place during a race. Instead, he ran to raise money for graduating seniors at Collingswood High School.,Specifically for their yearbooks -- which, at $75 per copy, can be pricey for some students.,""I had seen other runners still doing their marathons which is fun, but I wondered if I could tie a fundraising element into a run for my local high school since many of their fundraising events were canceled,"" Rodio told CNN. ""So through that I thought it'd be fun to run 20.20 miles for the class of 2020!"",The 177 seniors at Collingswood High School, like many around the nation, have had their final year disrupted due to the coronavirus pandemic. ,Classes are now conducted virtually, and their prom and in-person graduation ceremony have been canceled. Knowing that students have worked 12 years to get to their final year, Rodio wanted to help make sure they are all able to get their final keepsake.,""We have a lot of students that it would be hard for them to buy a yearbook,"" Robert Lewandowski, a commissioner of the town, told CNN. ""Now you add the economical impact that the pandemic has caused with people losing their jobs and that obstacle of purchasing a yearbook is that much harder."",Through the use of Collingswood Cares, a local non-profit that helps provide meals and transportation to families in need, Lewandowski helped Rodio set up an online fundraising site for people to donate money as he completed the run. ,On Sunday, Rodio wore a neon green shirt that said ""run 856"" on the front -- the town's area code and the local running club's name -- and sprinted through the streets. ,The town is small, so the course Rodio took entailed doing a loop through the local park and passing by the high school. After 14 times around this course, he completed his the race in a little over three hours.,Students, parents and even other runners showed up to cheer him on, all while maintaining social distancing, of course. They held signs of encouragement, rang cowbells and honked their car horns to show their support. ,By Tuesday evening, Rodio had raised over $5,000.,""This fundraiser has been a great reminder of the way our school district and community will do whatever it takes to support our students,"" Matthew Genna, principal at Collingswood High School, told CNN. ""This gesture by Mr. Rodio, and all those who supported the fundraiser, was a special tribute to our seniors, who certainly deserve something special during this difficult time.""  ,This act of kindness even reached New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, who tweeted out gratitude for Rodio. ,The fundraising website will continue until this weekend, Rodio said. Anything extra they raise will be used to give scholarships to students.,© 2019 Cable News Network. Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. All Rights Reserved."
"New York  (CNN Business) - Virgin Galactic, the space tourism company slated to begin flying customers in the near future, posted a net loss of $60 million for the first three months of 2020.,The company's latest earnings report comes as it continues to work toward beginning commercial operations. Its shares have been hammered by the economic fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic over the past few months, just like the broader stock market, but the company's stock is still up about 50% so far in 2020.,Virgin Galactic's founder, British billionaire Richard Branson, is expected to be the first non-crew member to fly aboard the company's suborbital vehicle, SpaceShipTwo. The company has said it's working to reach that milestone this year.,Galactic plans to send groups of paying customers on brief, scenic flights to the edge of space, where they'll float weightless for a few minutes while viewing the cosmos through the plane's windows. They'll also encounter intense G-forces as the space plane rockets its way to more than 50 miles above Earth.,Tickets for the trip to space were sold for about $250,000, and the company says it had received about 600 reservations. Plans to re-open ticket sales kicked off a few months ago, and CEO George Whitesides said about 400 people have so far put down $1,000 refundable deposits. Whitesides has said newly sold tickets will likely be even pricier than $250,000.,Sam Korus, an industrial innovation analyst at ARK Invest, said the additional deposits showed that there could be sustained interest in space tourism.,""Coming into this earnings call with the environment as is, it was all steps in the right direction,"" Korus said, referring to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. ,Korus said he was also encouraged by the fact that Virgin Galactic reported having about $420 million in cash on hand, suggesting the company could have enough money to finish its test flights before commercial operations begin.,Galactic's meteoric rise is evidence of Wall Street's hunger to invest in cutting-edge space companies. And though Virgin Galactic is only a small slice of that industry, it is the only so-called ""new space"" company that's publicly traded. The biggest players, including SpaceX and Blue Origin, are private and will likely remain that way for the immediate future.,But Galactic's rise in market value since the start of the year came as the company reported no big changes in its underlying business.,Morgan Stanley said in a research note last week that it considers Virgin Galactic's stock to be an attractive investment ""in part due to its position as the only pure-play publicly traded space"" company, and ""a growth outlook we see as largely insulated from Covid-19 factors."" ,Analysts have also hyped up the potential for Galactic to parlay its rocket technology into an air travel business that shuttles people between cities at record speeds. One analyst predicted such an industry could grow to bring in roughly $300 billion in annual revenue.,Virgin Galactic has long talked about conducting point-to-point flights. Boeing in October invested $20 million in the company in a deal focused largely on aiding development of high-speed transportation, and Virgin Galactic announced Tuesday that it signed a deal with NASA to aid that development.,Developing supersonic point-to-point travel technology, which many companies in the aerospace world are taking on to various degrees, is likely still years away from reality.,So far, Virgin Galactic has completed two powered test flights to the edge of space over the company's testing facilities in Mojave, California.,The company's space plane was recently transported to New Mexico, the eventual launch destination for Virgin Galactic's tourism customers. Last week, its space plane conducted a glide test, in which the space plane took flight but did not power up its rocket engine, over New Mexico.,""The fact that we were able to get this flight off in that time was heartening to me, because it suggested that we are able to create updated operational protocols that allow our team to operate safely"" during the pandemic, Whitesides said during a conference call Tuesday.,© 2019 Cable News Network.

"(CNN) - In many ways, Wendy Williams was built for this moment in television. ,While she says she misses the ""electricity"" of ""The Wendy Williams Show"" studio audience, Williams believes her years spent as a radio host prepared her well for talking into the ether. As she continues to host her syndicated talk show from home amid the coronavirus pandemic, that's the only skill she really needs. ,""If it wasn't for radio, I could not do this quarantine thing from home thing properly,"" Williams tells CNN. ""I've so enjoyed this 11 going on 12 years of doing the talk show with the studio and hundreds of people and clapping and the immediate response. I've so enjoyed that, but it is much easier for me as a host to be here at home, with no audience, because it's always been about description. You know, I've been a radio host longer than I've been a TV host, so yes, right. Thank God for radio."",At first Williams was reluctant to film the show at home, she says, because she considers her home space sacred. Plus, she wasn't digging the look of seeing other TV personalities in their homes. ""Looking disgusting,"" she laughs, ""I'm just saying."",""The whole apartment is my office as far as I'm concerned [now],"" Williams says. ""But no, you know, when quarantine first got started, I was reluctant to do it because I always feel that I give so much of myself when I do the show for the last 11 plus years, that I want a place that I can call my own."",Eventually, with the prompting of her production team, Williams gave in. The same camera man is allowed in each morning to film Williams in her kitchen, and she says he and her team are in charge of all the ""buttons and wires,"" because she has zero interest in working the equipment. He rings her bell, films the show, and then it goes to post-production. All she has to do is show up in her own kitchen and talk.,""I have the same person come over every single day. He's on time. He flips the switches, he sits over there, away from me. We get it done,"" she says. ""Then my computer shows a whole gang of people from production."",As for wardrobe and glam, Williams has been sifting deep though her own closet, choosing between colorful robes and comfortable tops. She is good at doing her own hair and makeup, she says, another skill she attributes to her time in radio. ,""I've got a closet galore, right?"" she says. ""I pull out a robe and you know, sit in my chair and I've got my stuff around me and I'm a natural, it's like I am born to do exactly what I'm doing. So, this is not a stretch for me."",Williams says she's in a positive place these days, and credits her production staff for helping keep the show on the air. ,""We work so well as a team,"" she says. ""I'm enjoying this process."",When she's not working, Williams says she loves to people watch from her window with binoculars, orders takeout and hangs with her two rescue cats, Chit Chat and My Way, who run when they see the camera. She's content, but looking forward to getting back to the studio. ,""Until I get the thumbs up, I'm not leaving the house. I enjoy my surroundings. I enjoy my apartment. I've got plenty of cat food, kitty litter, I've got plenty of food here. My cable works, you know, it smells beautiful. It looks beautiful in here. I have a perfect view of everything,"" she says, but when the world gets up and running, she adds, ""I will probably be the one to sleep over in my office the night before, and I will be the one to unlock the door and turn on the lights and welcome everyone back."",© 2019 Cable News Network.

"(CNN) - The coronavirus pandemic has closed retail shops, schools and so much more. But in Bloomington, Indiana, Middle Way House, a shelter for survivors of domestic violence, has stayed open with help from its dedicated staff and volunteers, which includes Oscar-nominated actor Jesse Eisenberg and his wife, Anna Strout. ,And the organization is not alone. ,On Giving Tuesday, the holiday normally scheduled for after Thanksgiving that is being celebrated early in response to the global health crisis, Eisenberg wants to spread the word that domestic violence shelters across the country have been and remain open and are in need of support. ,Eisenberg and comedian/writer Amy Schumer teamed up to narrate a public service announcement with this message in mind that was released on Tuesday. ,""We just want people to know that domestic violence is on the rise and that, even during this horrible time, shelters are open and that resources are available,"" he said. ,Eisenberg, an actor known for his roles in ""The Social Network"" and the ""Zombieland"" films, has made Middle Way House a sort of charitable home of his for many years, having been introduced to the organization by his late mother-in-law, Toby Strout, who was its executive director. ,In the years since taking his first tour of the facility, Eisenberg has dedicated significant time and money to raise awareness of its vital services -- transitional housing, childcare, legal advocacy, and mental health support, to name a few -- and the issue at its core. ,As the pandemic strengthened its grip on the globe and the United States, Eisenberg and his family packed up their things in Los Angeles and headed for Indiana in an RV, where they self-quarantined for two weeks before jumping into action at the shelters.,Middle Way House, like many organizations, has been in need of staffing help because its college student volunteer base largely left town when classes were canceled. ,""My wife and I are very involved on a day-to-day level -- painting and cleaning and mopping. And there's a lot of sterilization to be done, as you can imagine, right now -- door knobs and elevator buttons, et cetera,"" he told CNN. ""I married a person who is a walking saint and so she has not spent a day in her life not doing something to help those most in need. So, for her, it was kind of without hesitancy that we should come here and figure out ways to help."",As much of the country adopted stay at home orders, those who are not safe at home were of particular concern, and, ultimately, those worries were warranted. Domestic abuse hotlines in several cities reported an increase in calls and cases in early April. ,""Unfortunately, there's a kind of strange asterisks to all of this, which is that in a lot of areas, calls are actually going down because, oftentimes, people who are victims feel unsafe to make those calls when they're stuck in the same room as their abuser,"" Eisenberg said.,The need for places like Middle Way House is greater than ever, he said, and he's not the only one who believes so. ,When Eisenberg and his wife arrived in Indiana, they got word of a generous donation from Schumer. ,""Our friend, the actress and writer Amy Schumer, who's just obviously a brilliant talent and also has a wonderful heart, said, 'I'm donating $50,000 to your shelter.' No questions asked,"" he told CNN. ""It was so unbelievable."" ,Eisenberg and Strout matched the donation and hope people who are able find organizations that help domestic abuse victims to support in their local communities.  ,""Shelters are open now 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year, even during this pandemic,"" he said. ,© 2019 Cable News Network.

"Editor's Note: Roxanne Jones, a founding editor of ESPN Magazine and former vice president at ESPN, has been a producer, reporter and editor at the New York Daily News and The Philadelphia Inquirer. Jones is co-author of ""Say it Loud: An Illustrated History of the Black Athlete."" She talks politics, sports and culture weekly on Philadelphia's 900AM WURD. The views expressed here are solely hers. Read more opinion on CNN.,(CNN) - Even in grade school, I longed to tell stories the stories of black folk -- about our lives, our loves and the fears and frustrations we lived with every day. I wanted to give a voice and a face to the amazing people I encountered every day who mostly felt invisible or marginalized in America. ,I imagined writing about my fun-loving grandfather, a proud veteran, who served this nation despite extreme racism and hatred he confronted his entire life -- on and off the battlefield. I dreamed of writing a book about my beautiful Aunt Rosie, who made the best potato salad I've ever tasted and had the rarest of gifts: making everyone around her feel deeply loved. ,But it was after my father was murdered that I vowed to study hard, go to college and study journalism -- no simple goal for the daughter of a now-single mom struggling to raise three kids. But, I was determined. It was inexplicable to me that neither my dad's death -- nor the deaths of other black and brown people I knew -- ever made headlines, or, in my father's case, never even led to an arrest.  ,So, at 10-years-old, I made a plan. ,Problem was, I had never met a journalist, let alone one who looked like me.  Honestly, most people laughed when I told them my plans. ,But I did know all about Ida B. Wells, the black woman and activist who was posthumously honored this week with a special Pulitzer Citation. The awards committee accepts submissions from deceased writers as long as the work is not a collection of writings that have been edited after the author's death. Other posthumous awards have gone to musicians Bob Dylan and Hank Williams, and composers Thelonious Monk and George Gershwin. ,Wells was recognized for her work as one of the nation's first and most intrepid investigative reporters. Today, she is credited with helping to lay the very foundation for investigative reporting. The Pulitzer citation comes with a bequest of at least $50,000, with recipients to be announced at a later date.,Thanks to the well-worn set of Britannica encyclopedias proudly displayed in our tiny, third-floor apartment, and hours spent in the library reading black history books, I learned about Wells and her career early in my childhood. I loved reading about how this young, fearless black woman, born in 1862, had used the power of the pen to fight against injustice and racism.  ,Just after the Civil War, Wells launched a crusade against lynchings in the South and published pamphlets-turned books titled: ""Southern Horrors"" and ""The Red Record."" Her books used facts, firsthand information and statistics to record lynchings and details of the murders.  ,""In slave times the Negro was kept subservient and submissive by the frequency and severity of the scourging, but, with freedom, a new system of intimidation came into vogue; the Negro was not only whipped and scourged; he was killed,"" Wells wrote in ""The Red Record,"" for which Frederick Douglass wrote the introduction. ,Her work boldly challenged the pernicious myth that black men were being lynched for raping white women, and she wrote about the murders for what they were: a terror campaign designed to oppress black Americans.  ,Wells, who was later one of the founders of the NAACP, also co-owned and edited her own newspaper called The Memphis Free Speech and Headlight. And it was at her paper, under constant death threats and attacks, that she began to travel the nation investigating and reporting on lynchings. Wells was only 30-years-old at the time. Even after opposition to her reporting made it unsafe for her to return to Memphis, Wells devoted her life to fighting for justice and equality.,And even today, nearly 89 years after her death in 1931, Wells is empowering young black women to continue her fight. Nikole Hannah-Jones of The New York Times was also awarded a Pulitzer Prize this week for her groundbreaking 1619 Project. The brilliant collection of personal essays and investigative reporting examines the impact of slavery 400 years after the first slaves arrived in America.,It is because of Wells, and other freedom fighters like her -- Harriet Tubman, Frederick Douglass, Martin Luther King Jr. and so many more -- black girls like me dared to dream that our words could be used as a weapon against hate and fear. She taught us the power of telling our own stories.,Ida B. Wells gave America a precious gift: A long legacy of women honored to walk in her shadow and continue her work. And it's satisfying to finally see Wells' place in history recognized and rewarded. She was a great American who believed in truth and freedom. ,And, it's time for more of the world to know her story. ,© 2019 Cable News Network. Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.

This is the essence of law enforcement and is why I have dedicated my life to service in law enforcement."",Tony was initially charged as an adult, but his case was transferred to juvenile court, where a judge found him not guilty and sealed his records, the Florida Bulldog reported.,Tony eventually left Philadelphia and moved to Florida to play football at Florida State University, where he graduated with a degree in criminology.,His career in law enforcement began when he joined the Coral Springs Police Department SWAT team in 2005. ,Tony did not mention the shooting when he applied to become a law enforcement officer in Coral Springs or when DeSantis appointed him as sheriff, according to the Florida Bulldog.,Tony told the Tampa Bay Times he has no regrets about not disclosing the shooting because he was never arrested.,""Under Pennsylvania law, they looked at this thing and found no just cause for any type of crime,"" he added. ,After the Pennsylvania juvenile justice system reviewed the incident, it was ""concluded there was no crime and cleared (Tony's) name,"" a spokesperson for the Broward County Sheriff's Office told CNN.,Becoming the  Broward County sheriff,DeSantis appointed Tony to replace Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel, who the governor suspended for failing ""in his duties to keep our families and children safe"" during the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, which left 14 students and three teachers dead.,Tony, who was appointed in January 2019, became the first black sheriff in Broward County's history.,""It's not like he's my sheriff. I didn't even know the guy. It's not like he was a political ally of mine,"" DeSantis said during a press conference Monday,,""The people I talked to in Broward have been pleased with what he's doing. That's ultimately a decision that the people in Broward can make. It's not going to be anything I'm going to be getting involved in."",A spokesperson for the Florida Department of Law Enforcement told CNN before his appointment as sheriff, they completed a level 1 background check on Tony. ,The agency included a court query with their request and found no court records in Pennsylvania. The FDLE also conducted a National Crime Information Center (NCIC) check and found no sealed records. ,When asked if Tony was obligated to disclose his involvement in the shooting, the spokesperson said they could not answer that question.,The governor said one of the reasons he appointed Tony was because he liked that the sheriff ""had come from real tough upbringing"" and was a great officer.,Tony is running against Israel in a heated race for the 2020 election of the next Broward sheriff.

"Washington  (CNN) - The relative strength of Nazism between regions and cities in 1930s Germany is correlated with the effects of the 1918 influenza pandemic, according to preliminary findings of a new study by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, a finding that has increased relevance as the world grapples with the widespread effects of the coronavirus pandemic.,The study, published this month by economist Kristian Blickle, examined ""city spending on amenities"" in some German municipalities and ""voting for extremist parties in Germany"" in the years between 1925 and 1933 and found that ""influenza deaths are associated with lower per capita spending, especially on services consumed by the young"" and that ""influenza deaths are correlated with the share of votes received by extremist parties in 1932 and 1933."",Historians have frequently pointed to the shame of Germany's defeat in World War I, the subsequent economic hardship placed on the country via reparations and other factors for the rise of Nazism. But the paper also notes that deaths from the 1918 pandemic ""are correlated with an increase in the share of votes won by right-wing extremists, such as the National Socialist Workers Party"" -- the Nazi Party -- ""in the crucial elections of 1932 and 1933."",Blickle also writes that the study found ""that the correlation between influenza mortality and the vote share won by right-wing extremists is stronger in regions that had historically blamed minorities, particularly Jews, for medieval plagues."",To be sure, the study does not suggest that the flu led to Nazism -- other countries suffered the flu and remained democratic -- but that the relative impact of the flu was correlated to strength in support for Nazism.,The economist notes that Germany was ideal for the study because it ""suffered a high number of influenza deaths"" and maintained thorough records at the time on pandemic-related deaths, voting and city spending. ,As of early Tuesday afternoon, the coronavirus has infected more than 1,190,000 in the United States and led to the confirmed deaths of more than 70,000 Americans. In addition to helping bring Great Depression-level economic figures, the virus, which was first identified in China, has also led to a significant increase in anti-Asian racism in the US. ,The new study, which said the coronavirus pandemic ""has renewed age-old questions about the economic and social effects"" of pandemics, said the influenza pandemic's impact in Germany ""may also have spurred resentment of foreigners among the survivors ... driving voters towards parties whose platform matched such sentiments."" ,""(The) fact that the pandemic affected predominantly one part of the demographic spectrum, in this case younger people, may have altered preferences in communities,"" the study read. ,Blickle also writes that because of ""a number of econometric challenges, we are cautious about the interpretation of our results,"" but that despite that, the paper ""offers a novel contribution to the discussion surrounding the long-term effects of pandemics."",© 2019 Cable News Network.

"Editor's Note: Kent Sepkowitz is a CNN medical analyst and a physician and infection control expert at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.,(CNN) - Control of the Covid-19 pandemic remains elusive. There are now more than 3.4 million cases around the world, with thousands of people dying every day.  Given limited treatment options and the difficulties of sustaining social distancing, many people see a vaccine as the only viable path forward.,But when will a Covid-19 vaccine be available?,I have no idea. And I promise, neither does anyone else. This is a heated moment with too much hope, too much fear, and too much on the line for anyone to have clear-eyed perspective. That said, for me, fall 2020 seems overly ambitious; even January 2021 is quite early for a safe and effective vaccine to be available for millions of people. ,Vaccines usually take years to develop; CanSinoBIO, a leading company in Beijing, recently received praise for moving an Ebola vaccine from concept to approval in just a little more than three years.,Why it is so difficult? After all, the basic approach to vaccine development has remained more or less the same for the past 200 years: trick the immune system into developing protection against a specific infection, be it smallpox or rotavirus. ,Sure, the scientific sleight of hand has changed dramatically.  We have moved from injecting live pathogens, to killed pathogens, to weakened but still alive pathogens to injecting genetic scraps from the pathogen using the latest techniques.  But chicanery has remained the basic MO.,Given all this know-how and our powerful computers, brilliant vaccine experts, lab space and plenty of money, many still wonder why we can't  just muscle our way forward.,Alas, it turns out that the modern age, though surely higher tech than the eras that came before, is still not up to the task of medical miracles on demand. Human biology remains far too complex for our minds (and our computers) to comprehend.,That said, this is an exciting moment. On April 30, the World Health Organization posted an up-to-date inventory of Covid-19 vaccine initiatives. The list included eight trials -- half of which are in China -- currently enrolling human volunteers, and 94 trials still in pre-clinical development.,In addition, health agencies, pharmaceutical and biotech companies, and researchers have pledged to collaborate closely across countries and scientific communities.,Before digging into the vaccine list, a quick terminology review: The starting place for a clinical trial is ""Phase 1,"" which is designed only to assess product safety. If there is no evidence of danger, the product progresses to ""Phase 2"" to determine whether the disease responds to the new product. If things look good, the last is ""Phase 3,"" usually a large randomized trial involving thousands of people to determine safety and efficacy at long last.,Of the eight trials currently enrolling volunteers, only three are in Phase 2. Of these, only the ""Oxford Trial"" (a Phase 1/Phase 2 hybrid) from the United Kingdom has prevention of Covid-19 infection, rather than a laboratory result, as the primary desired outcome.,Why? The Oxford team has the odd advantage of conducting the trial in Britain, where rates of infection are still high. Germany and China, however, lack sufficient cases to accurately test vaccine efficacy. And since ethical constraints prevent scientists from infecting participants with a serious disease, a consortium of German, Chinese and American companies are developing a product currently being tested only in Germany, that instead uses surrogate markers -- antibody measurements -- against the virus. Teams will examine both the amount and duration of antibodies against the disease created in response to the vaccine.,These groups have benefited from extensive experience in the field of vaccine development. They already have worked out certain techniques and theories, giving them a substantial head start -- a screaming endorsement for the long-term value of research that may not seem immediately pressing. As we now see, what may seem like an interesting but obscure pathogen today may be the cause of a pandemic tomorrow.,Though many teams are working toward a vaccine, many roadblocks have been developed to intentionally slow the process in the name of safety. The history of vaccination has cast a long, dark shadow of side effects, both real and imagined. Injecting foreign material into people hoping that it will trigger a specific reaction without stirring up anything else is a medical high-wire act that has come to seem routine. It is anything but, as the history of vaccines -- and vaccine discontinuation -- attests.,There is another potential pitfall as well: a worry that the vaccine might make the infection more severe.,This is more than just theory. For decades, dengue fever, a viral infection common in tropical climates, has been known to cause a much more severe infection the second time certain people develop the disease.,Many clinicians believe this phenomenon may occur after other respiratory infections -- including coronavirus -- though thorough investigation similar to the dengue work has not been done.  Indeed, the increased severity of the ""second wave"" of the 1918 Spanish Flu, with the predominance of fatalities in younger people, may have been due to hyper-inflammation, perhaps due to previous influenza exposure.,Thus some experts fear that if a Covid-19 vaccine does its job provoking the immune system, the body could go into a destructive overdrive when exposed to the actual virus.,This is a doomsday scenario to be sure, but one that is giving the scientific community substantial pause as the world rushes headlong toward a vaccine. Veteran vaccinologists remain haunted by past missteps and are speaking up; indeed, placing the focus on caution, not speed, is the plea of many who have been through this before.,The appropriate balance of urgent need against patient safety, they all agree, can be accomplished with thorough screening of volunteers and monitoring not only symptoms but markers of immune activity and over-activity. Regulatory involvement to aggregate any adverse events across a large study population also will be necessary to detect any early clusters of unexpected symptoms.,In many ways the new ""hurry versus slow down"" tension over vaccine development exactly recapitulates the ""anti-lockdown versus shelter-in-place"" conflict: one side desperate to return to life before the pandemic at any cost and the other arguing that safety must always come first.,And curiously, President Donald Trump's bromide that the cure must not be worse than the disease, while completely misguided for the issue of shelter-at-home, is on target for vaccine development. Because the only thing worse than no vaccine during a pandemic is a vaccine that makes matters worse.,© 2019 Cable News Network. Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. All Rights Reserved."
"Editor's Note: In this weekly column ""Cross Exam,"" Elie Honig, a CNN legal analyst and former federal and state prosecutor, gives his take on the latest legal news. Post your questions below. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. Watch Honig answer readers' questions on ""CNN Newsroom with Ana Cabrera"" at 5:40 p.m. ET Sundays.,(CNN) - House Democrats last week sought testimony from Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, about the Trump administration's handling of the coronavirus crisis. The White House quickly stepped in to block it, claiming that Fauci's testimony would be ""counter-productive."" Now the ball is back in the House Democrats' court, and they've given no indication of doing anything more than dropping it and skulking away.,But if House Democrats ever intend to get real answers about the administration's response to the coronavirus -- from Fauci or anybody else -- they need to toughen up. ,If this all sounds familiar, that's because it is. Just in the past year, we've seen this lopsided dance between Congress and the White House, time and again -- first when the House tried to investigate after the release of special counsel Robert Mueller's report, then during the impeachment investigation (and, in between, over testimony from Attorney General William Barr). Each time it's been the same pattern: The House demands crucial information, the White House tells the House to take a hike -- and the House does next to nothing to stand up for itself.  ,Sure, there have been rare exceptions. A few courageous executive branch employees -- Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, former Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch and others -- defied White House instructions and testified in the House impeachment proceedings. And the House (after inexplicably waiting nearly four months after the release of the Mueller report) finally went to court and followed through in its effort to compel testimony from former White House counsel Don McGahn. ,The still-ongoing McGahn case, and possibly the pending Supreme Court case involving Trump's tax returns, will answer a crucial question: Will the courts step in and compel the executive branch to comply with congressional subpoenas? If the ultimate answer from the courts is ""no,"" then it's game over, as the White House can freely disregard House subpoenas with no legal intervention.  ,But I expect the courts ultimately will decide that they do have the power to rule on and enforce congressional subpoenas to the executive branch. Indeed, every court to have heard the Trump tax returns cases thus far has found that the courts do have the ability to referee these disputes. And the entire Court of Appeals in the McGahn case has taken the rare step of rehearing the initial ruling of a smaller panel of judges to the contrary.,There are legitimate questions about whether the House should fight for Fauci's testimony now. It might indeed be counterproductive or premature, as the White House has claimed. But then why would the House request Fauci's testimony in the first place? It makes sense to request that testimony while the crisis is ongoing and any missteps can be identified and potentially remedied. The administration has said it will permit Fauci to testify in the House at some later, unidentified time, but time is of the essence, and there has been no solid, enforceable commitment.,Fauci reportedly will testify in the Republican-controlled Senate, before the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, on May 12. That's certainly better than nothing at all.  But there is a world of difference between taking questions about the administration's handling of the coronavirus on the friendly Republican-controlled home turf of the Senate rather than the Democratic-controlled House. And while, of course, even as the minority party, Democrats on the Senate committee will have a chance to question Fauci, Republicans, as the majority party, will have complete control over process and ground rules. Exhibit A: Compare the tenor and substance of the impeachment proceedings in the House, which involved days of substantive testimony about the facts of the Ukraine scandal, and the Senate, which allowed no witnesses and no new evidence whatsoever. ,In short, if House Democrats request information, and the White House blocks it, they need to be ready to serve a subpoena and then go to court to enforce it if necessary. Otherwise, neither the House nor the American public will get meaningful answers and accountability -- on coronavirus or anything else.  ,Now, your questions:,Elaine (Utah): Who decides whether mail-in balloting is available for the November general election -- the states or the federal government?  ,Generally, decisions about manner of voting -- mail-in versus in-person voting, for example -- are made by the states, not the federal government or the president. Five states (Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Utah and Washington) already conduct their elections entirely by mail. Over two dozen states -- including potential presidential swing states Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- allow ""no-excuse"" absentee voting, meaning voters do not need to provide any reason or excuse to vote by mail. Another one third of states allow voting by mail, but only if the voter shows specific ""cause"" or need, such as age, disability, absentee status or religious observance.,States can also pass legislation changing their rules. The trend has been toward expanding mail-in voting options -- Pennsylvania and Virginia recently expanded access by going to a ""no-excuse"" system. If anything, that trend may accelerate now, given the emergency conditions caused by the coronavirus.  ,Opponents of such rule changes can try to challenge them in courts -- but face an uphill climb to establish that such legislation is illegal or unconstitutional, given the states' broad authority to administer elections. (The recent dispute over voting in Wisconsin concerned a last-minute extension of deadlines for mail-in ballots, but not the actual manner of voting).,Congress could pass a law standardizing the manner of mail-in voting across the states. But no such law has ever been passed, and it is doubtful that both the current Democratic-controlled House and Republican-controlled Senate would agree on the details. Despite Trump's stated opposition -- ""Mail ballots are a very dangerous thing for this country because they are cheaters,"" he declared -- there is nothing he can do on his own to stop states from adopting or expanding mail-in voting.  ,Even if Trump directed the Justice Department to sue to prevent states from accepting or expanding mail-in voting, that suit likely would fail given the near-total lack of evidence of mail-in voting fraud.,John (California): What are the next steps after the federal court of appeals makes its ruling on the House subpoena to McGahn?,The ""en banc"" (the entire available court, totaling nine judges) ruling could come at any time now that the court has heard oral arguments, and that ruling will supplant the original ruling by the three-judge panel. Whichever side loses almost certainly will then seek ""certiorari"" (review) by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court does not have to take any case, and it requires a vote of four of the nine Justices to grant review. The Supreme Court typically agrees to hear only a small fraction of all cases brought to it, usually around 1%.  ,That said, the McGahn case poses such an important issue of constitutional law -- impacting the balance of powers between Congress and the executive branch -- that it's a strong candidate for Supreme Court review. If the Court hears the case, then of course it will have the final say. If not, then the forthcoming en banc decision from the Court of Appeals in Washington DC will decide the matter. ,Brad (Wisconsin): What happens if the Supreme Court declares that the Trump tax returns cases are political and not justiciable? ,Interestingly, the court last week requested additional briefing from the parties on whether the case presents a ""political question"" or other justiciability issue -- meaning the court has asked the parties whether it even has the legal ability to rule.,If the court concludes that it does not have the power to rule on the case, then the short-term effect is that the banks -- who have indicated that they will comply with the subpoenas, unless the court finds the subpoenas invalid -- will turn the requested financial information over to Congress. That would be a win for Congress and a loss for Trump.,But, bigger picture, such a ruling could make it difficult or impossible for Congress to enforce its subpoenas to the executive branch or to third parties (like the banks) where the executive branch objects, if the third party is unwilling to comply voluntarily.,Three questions to watch,1. Will House Democrats subpoena Fauci and go to court to enforce it if necessary?,2. Will we get a ruling from the Court of Appeals on the McGahn case?,3. Will Barr agree to let Trump's former national security adviser Michael Flynn rescind his guilty plea, or will Trump issue a pardon?,© 2019 Cable News Network. Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.

"(CNN) - Dr. Anthony Fauci, a key member of the White House coronavirus task force, said Monday evening that calls for his dismissal are ""part of the game"" as he continues to urge Americans to practice social distancing. ,Fauci has been targeted by critics online who are unhappy with his recommendations to continue social distancing in order to slow the spread of the coronavirus. President Donald Trump breathed life into these complaints when he retweeted an individual who used the hashtag ""#FireFauci"" in a tweet last month, though the President emphasized that he had no plans to dismiss the nation's top infectious disease expert from the coronavirus task force.,""There are people that are going to be disagreeing with me. Some of them, rather violently in many respects, you know, telling me that I am crazy, fire Fauci, do this, do that. That is part of the game,"" Fauci told CNN's Chris Cuomo on ""Cuomo Prime Time."",""I am just going to keep giving you the information that I feel is necessary to make that decisions that I think are prudent decisions."",His comments come as more states loosen their stay-at-home orders, prompting researchers to predict a sharp increase in the virus's death toll this summer. Public health experts, including Fauci, have repeatedly stressed the dangers of relaxing social distancing measures too early.,""I feel I have a moral obligation to give the kind of information that I am giving,"" he said Monday. ""People are going to make their own choices, I cannot -- nor anybody -- force people under every circumstance, to do what you'd think is best."",Fauci has garnered sustained criticism from the President's allies in conservative media for his willingness to directly refute Trump and counter his more optimistic rhetoric about the pandemic. Among them was the conservative who called for Fauci to be fired after he said in a CNN interview more could have been done to prevent the spread of coronavirus. ,Trump retweeted it but later pushed back on the idea that he might fire Fauci.,""Today I walk in, I hear I'm going to fire him. I'm not firing him. I think he is a wonderful guy,"" the President told reporters during the daily White House briefing.,Trump said his retweet doesn't matter, and the tweet was ""somebody's opinion."" The President said he did notice the ""fire Fauci"" hashtag before he retweeted it.,""This was a person's view. Not everybody's happy with Anthony. Not everybody is happy with everybody,"" he said. ""But I will tell you, we have done a job the likes of which nobody has ever done."",© 2019 Cable News Network. Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. All Rights Reserved."
"New York  (CNN Business) - Crowded theme parks. Theaters packed with boisterous Marvel and Star Wars fans. Bustling hotels, cruise ships and retail stores. No media company seems more vulnerable to social distancing than Disney. ,Over the last century, Disney has built a sprawling empire centered around entertaining large crowds in dense spaces. But following one of its best years ever in 2019 — including the record-breaking release of ""Avengers: Endgame"" and the launch of new Star Wars lands at its theme parks — the pandemic brought Disney to a halt in a matter of days.,Executives like executive chairman Bob Iger and new CEO Bob Chapek are in the midst of dealing with the health and economic crisis. Yet as they deal with the immediate blow to earnings, the longer-term question lingers as to whether Disney's assets — which have become sudden liabilities because of the virus — could offer a light at the end of the tunnel.,'It has gone from great to good to bad to worse',""What everyone's worrying about is that we don't know when things are going to get back to normal. We also don't know whether behaviors change in the future,"" Michael Nathanson, a media analyst and founding partner at MoffettNathanson, told CNN Business. ""Will people be reluctant to go to parks? Will people want to sit in the theater next to strangers for fear of catching the virus? That's what the market is wrestling with when it comes to Disney."",The pandemic has hit Disney particularly hard. Its parks and resorts have closed around the world, major films like ""Mulan"" and ""Black Widow"" are delayed, and one of its biggest media networks, ESPN, is scrambling to fill its airtime due to a lack of sports.,This has led Disney to furlough thousands of employees, led Standard & Poors to downgrade the company's credit rating, and led its stock to drop 27% year to date. Disney did not have a comment on this story.,The company will report its earnings after the bell Tuesday, and investors are eager to learn just how deeply the pandemic has hurt Disney's business.,""With the businesses unable to operate, Disney is just going to get decimated in 2020 on free cash flow and profitability,"" Nathanson added. ""It has gone from great to good to bad to worse."",However, Disney is still Disney — a company with a beloved brand and an array of franchises that remain the envy of the industry. As consumers grapple with the psychological effects of being locked up for so long, will there be pent-up demand in the long-term for Disney's crowd-based entertainment experiences? ,Or will consumer habits shift for good?,'No one is suddenly bored of Disney',""The ability for Disney to thrive in so many applications — TV, comics, film, parks, books, on-ice shows, video games — is encouraging,"" Matthew Ball, a former Amazon Studios executive, told CNN Business. ""Most companies don't have the intellectual property, let alone the culture or skill set, that Disney does when it comes to finding out how to delight customers in new ways and through new products in a post-COVID world."",Ball added that ""no one is suddenly bored of Disney"" and that before coronavirus, ""no media company was more beloved."",Suzanne Scott, an assistant professor at the University of Texas' Moody College of Communication, echoed this point, telling CNN Business that Disney fans are ""incredibly loyal to the brand."" She doesn't believe that this crisis will change that.,""We associate Disney with family, which is at the forefront of everyone's mind right now,"" she said. Scott emphasized that people will be craving events and communal experiences once it is safe to collectively gather again."",Robert Niles, editor of ThemeParkInsider.com, believes that Disney's parks and resorts will face the greatest challenges in terms of reopening, and that those challenges probably won't be resolved any time soon. However, he added that Disney has spent years and billions to position itself as ""a lifestyle brand — not just an entertainment company or a vacation destination."" ,That bond with consumers gives Disney ""an enormous head start relative to its competition when stay-at-home orders lift,"" he said.,""Millions of Disney fans are sitting at home right now, watching Disney+, wearing Disney-branded clothes, reading Disney books and listening to Disney music,"" Niles told CNN Business. ""Even though people have had to stay away from theaters and theme parks, they've never had to stay away from Disney."",While 2020 looks destined to be a disaster for Disney, there is one bright spot for the company: Disney+.,In just five months, the company's nascent streaming service racked up 50 million paid subscribers globally, a number it originally projected would take nearly four years to hit. Even Reed Hastings, Netflix's CEO, praised the launch of Disney+ during his own company's recent earnings call, saying ""I've never seen such a good execution of the incumbent learning the new way and mastering it."",Trip Miller, a Disney investor and managing partner at hedge fund Gullane Capital partners, believes Disney+ is vital to the company right now. And that's not just because it's Disney's future. He believes the streaming platform keeps the company in the hearts, minds and living rooms of consumers.,""If there's one silver lining for Disney from this terrible crisis, it's that it has pushed more people to consume the company's content even faster than anyone expected,"" he said. ""Can you imagine if this was two years ago and they didn't have Disney+?"",Into the unknown,While Disney+ appears to be well ahead of schedule, with so many parts of the company idled or hobbled, it's not enough to compensate for the setbacks.,Ball noted that Disney is an ""incredibly diversified media company"" and that's usually ""an advantage in times of crisis, as it affords stability and limits overall exposure."",""But COVID-19 is hitting nearly every element of Disney,"" he added. ""The only exception is really its streaming services, Hulu and Disney+, but neither is profitable yet."",Given its strong stable of pop-culture properties, Disney has the branding, assets and consumer loyalty to rebound from the coronavirus. But no one knows how long recovery will take, and what permanent financial damage is being done to Disney in the process.,So for the first time in decades, the company is heading into an unknown future — one that no amount of Disney magic can fix right now.,""If things came back to normal, Disney's rise would likely be equal to its fall,"" Nathanson said.

Wendy's is ""more exposed"" to the shortage sparked by the coronavirus pandemic because of its reliance on fresh beef compared with its competitors, the note said.,Wendy's said some of its menu items might be ""temporarily limited at some restaurants in this current environment."" The company said its delivery schedule remains unchanged, but supply has been tight because beef suppliers across North America face production challenges during the pandemic. ,Many meat suppliers have temporarily closed their factories because workers are falling ill from Covid-19.,""We're working diligently to minimize the impact to our customers and restaurants, and continue to work with our supplier partners to monitor this closely,"" a Wendy's spokesperson said. ,The company is scheduled to report its first-quarter earnings Wednesday. ,The severity of Wendy's shortages depends on the ""geographic nature of processing plant closures,"" wrote Stephens analyst James Rutherford. In states such as Ohio, Michigan and New York, around 30% of Wendy's are out of fresh meat. Other states, like Arizona, Nevada and Louisiana, aren't affected. ,Wendy's online menus have shifted in recent days: They are emphasizing chicken sandwiches, Rutherford said in his note to investors.,Rutherford doesn't expect the beef shortages to hurt Wendy's profits if the shortage is fixed quickly.

"New York  (CNN Business) - Hertz has received a temporary lifeline from a group of its lenders, as it tries to find a way to survive near-zero travel during the Covid-19 pandemic.,The company had missed an April 27 payment due to a group of lenders who lease vehicles used in Hertz's day-to-day United States rental car fleet. The one-week grace period for the payment expired on Monday, but the lifeline was extended.,On Tuesday morning, Hertz said that lenders had given it until May 22 ""to engage in discussions ... with the goal to develop a financing strategy and structure that better reflects the economic impact of the Covid-19 global pandemic and Hertz' ongoing operating and financing requirements."",Hertz's stock fell 11% Tuesday and is down 80% this year.,The company rents cars under the Hertz, Dollar, Thrifty and Firefly brands. Firefly is a discount brand outside the United States.,In total, the company has 568,000 vehicles and 12,400 corporate and franchise locations worldwide. About a third of those locations are at airports, and those locations accounted for two-thirds of Hertz's revenue last year. That's a problem given that the number of people flying through US airports is down about 95%, according to screening data from TSA.,A significant portion of Hertz' non-airport business is renting cars to people who are having their vehicles repaired after accidents. But with so many people out of work or working from home, the miles being driven and the number of car accidents are also down significantly. Car insurers are voluntarily returning more than $7 billion, or between 15% to 25% of premiums, to their customers.,On April 14, Hertz notified 10,000 employees in North America that that they were losing their jobs, equal to about a third of the 38,000 employees in its US workforce. About a quarter of its US employees at the start of the year were represented by either the Teamsters or Machinists unions.,Hertz posted annual revenue of $9.8 billion last year, a record for the company, and its rental car revenue is comparable to that of rival Avis Budget Group. But Hertz has been having profitability problems that pre-date the Covid-19 pandemic. It posted a $58 million net loss in 2019, down from a $225 million loss in 2018.,Hertz was started in 1918 when founder Walter Jacobs bought 12 Model T cars.

Chris Christie said Monday that the country needs to reopen, despite separate key coronavirus models forecasting that thousands may die daily in the United States from Covid-19 and that more than 100,000 may die in total.,""Of course, everybody wants to save every life they can -- but the question is, towards what end, ultimately?"" Christie, a Republican tapped to lead President Donald Trump's presidential transition team in 2016, told CNN's Dana Bash on The Daily DC Podcast. ""Are there ways that we can... thread the middle here to allow that there are going to be deaths, and there are going to be deaths no matter what?"",Christie told Bash that ""we've got to let some of these folks get back to work, because if we don't, we're going to destroy the American way of life in these families -- and it will be years and years before we can recover."" His comments Monday echoed similar characterizations by other Republicans -- including President Donald Trump -- that the economic impact of coronavirus is just as devastating to the nation as the virus itself.,When Bash pressed Christie on whether people would be able to accept reopening in light of news of a Trump administration model projecting a rise up to about 3,000 daily US deaths from coronavirus by June 1, Christie responded, ""They're gonna have to."",""We're in the midst of a pandemic that we haven't seen in over 100 years,"" he said. ""And we're going to have to continue to do things."",With governors facing mounting pressure mounting to reopen their states' economies and Trump itching to scale back on social distancing nationwide as soon as possible, more than half of states had lifted aspects of their stay-at-home orders as of Monday. ,Yet, a separate influential coronavirus model often cited by the White House is now forecasting that 134,000 people will die of Covid-19 in the United States, nearly double its previous prediction. The model, from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, had predicted 72,433 deaths as of Monday morning.,Christie, asked Monday what his messaging would be to the American public if he sat in the Oval Office, said, ""The message is that the American people have gone through significant death before."" He pointed to the first and second World Wars as examples of how ""we've gone through it and we've survived it. We sacrificed those lives."",""We sent our young men during World War Two over to Europe, out to the Pacific, knowing, knowing that many of them would not come home alive,"" he said, adding: ""And we decided to make that sacrifice because what we were standing up for was the American way of life. In the very same way now, we have to stand up for the American way of life."",The former governor lamented the ""economic devastation"" as ""equally sad,"" and told Bash that while he wasn't advocating for crowded public gatherings like rock concerts or football games, ""we have to let certain people get back to work because I can see my own state here."" ,Christie encouraged vulnerable populations to stay indoors, as ""they're the ones who are gonna really swallow this burden badly, the elderly and those with respiratory diseases, depressed immune systems from cancer treatments or other things."",""Those folks are going to have to be even more careful than the rest of the population,"" he added. ""I don't know what the choice is."",© 2019 Cable News Network. Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. All Rights Reserved."
"(CNN) - The former Senate staffer who has accused Joe Biden of sexually assaulting her when she worked for him in 1993 says she filed a complaint with a Capitol Hill personnel office at the time.,The former staffer, Tara Reade, has said she doesn't have a copy of the complaint and that it is not about the alleged sexual assault, but about uncomfortable interactions she says she experienced while working for Biden.,Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, has denied Reade's allegation, and has called on the Senate to locate and make the complaint public, if it exists.,""To the best of my understanding there has been no complaints made against me in any Senate career,"" Biden said in an interview with MSNBC. ""This is an open book. There is nothing to hide."",The Secretary of the Senate, after consulting with legal counsel, has said it cannot confirm or deny the existence of a complaint or make one public.,Reade's allegation has set off a host of questions about whether the complaint exists -- and if it does, where it could be and who might have access to it. Here's what we know about the alleged complaint:,What Reade has said about the complaint,Reade has told CNN that she filed a complaint with a personnel office on Capitol Hill in 1993 while she was working in Biden's Senate office about interactions with Biden that allegedly made her feel uncomfortable. She said that the complaint addressed only the alleged sexual harassment, and not the alleged sexual assault.,Reade said she did not have a copy of the said complaint, and that she also was not sure what the name of the office where she filed it was.,Additionally, Reade has said she verbally complained to three supervisors at the time about the alleged sexual harassment. All three have told CNN and other media outlets that they never received such a verbal complaint from Reade, and were furthermore never aware of any sexual harassment complaints from anybody against Biden in the years that they worked with him.,What one of Tara Reade's friends said about the complaint,Reade has told CNN that the people she told about the alleged assault at the time included a close friend. CNN interviewed the friend, who asked to remain anonymous in order to protect her privacy.,According to the friend, Reade told her on multiple occasions while she was working in Biden's Senate office about physical interactions with the then-senator that had made her feel uncomfortable. She said she encouraged Reade to raise the problem with her bosses. Reade told her she did several times but that ""nothing changed,"" according to the friend.,The friend said she encouraged Reade to fill out a complaint at a personnel office on Capitol Hill, and that she agreed to be listed as a contact on the complaint form. The friend said that after Reade filled out the report, Reade told her she had filled out the form ""on paper, on a clipboard."" The friend said she never heard from anyone at a personnel office about Reade.,Filing a complaint on Capitol Hill in 1993,The office that handled complaints of the nature Reade would have filed in 1993 on Capitol Hill was the Office of Senate Fair Employment Practices. The House had a similar office, known as the Office of Fair Employment Practices. Both offices were established in the Civil Rights Act of 1991.,If an alleged violation was filed with the Senate's office, a procedure would kick in that would have included a hearing by a ""board of independent hearing officers."" The law also allows for review of any alleged violations by the Senate's Select Committee on Ethics, according to the statute.  ,University of Delaware records remain under seal,Since Reade came forward with her assault allegation, there have been calls for records from Biden's time in the Senate given to the University of Delaware to be released to the public.,But Biden said during an MSNBC interview that the records at the University of Delaware from his time in the Senate are his personal records and do not contain personnel files.,""They don't contain any personnel files, they are public records, my speeches, my papers, my position papers, and if that document existed, it would be stored in the National Archives where documents from the office she claims to have filed her complaint with are stored,"" Biden said during the interview.,The University of Delaware received a collection of papers, video and media from Biden's more than three decades in the Senate in June of 2012. The collection includes 1,850 boxes of archival records, according to the university. The university plans to make the archival collection publicly available two years after Biden retires from public life, a common practice for these types of collections donated by former government officials.,When asked why Biden wouldn't release the records donated to the university now, he said those records contain ""speeches I've made, positions I've taken, interviews that I did"" and if they became public during his presidential run, ""they could be really taken out of context.""  ,The collection is still being curated by the school's librarians. Documents and media in the collection are still being archived, and that process will likely continue into 2021, according to University of Delaware spokeswoman Andrea Boyle. Regardless of when the collection is complete, the records will remain closed to the public until two years after Biden retires from public life, she said.,The only person who could give permission for anyone at the school to release documents to anyone else would be through ""express consent"" from Biden, the university said in a statement.,No one on behalf of Biden or his campaign has visited the collection at the university since November 2019, according to the university. When anyone from Biden's staff has visited the collection, they have been accompanied by members of the library's Special Collections department, Boyle said. No documents have been added or removed during any of these visits, she added.,Stored in National Archives, under 'control' of the Senate,During his interview on MSNBC, Biden said all personnel records from his Senate office would be stored in the National Archives.,The National Archives said in a statement to CNN after Biden's on-camera interview aired that ""personnel complaints from 1993"" are ""under the control of the Senate."",The Archives said all further inquiries about locating Reade's alleged complaint should be directed to the Senate.,Biden asks Secretary of the Senate to release any documents related to Reade,Biden sent a letter to the Secretary of the Senate on Friday asking the office to ""direct whatever steps are necessary"" to locate and make public any complaint from Reade.,The Secretary of the Senate responded to Biden in a public statement, saying its office had ""no discretion to disclose"" those records because it is prohibited by federal law.,Biden's personal attorney, Bob Bauer, responded to the Secretary of the Senate by asking a series of questions regarding the documents.,Bauer asked if the Secretary of the Senate could disclose even the existence of such a complaint. He also asked if anyone, like the person who made the complaint, is legally allowed to see copies of those records. Bauer additionally asked if the Senate could release ""procedures and related materials"" including ""any standard forms or instructions"" that the Office of Senate Fair Employment Practices would have used in 1993. ,The secretary's office responded by saying that releasing the records to anyone would be a ""prohibited disclosure"" under the law and that even disclosing the existence of any complaint is prohibited.,The office also provided Bauer with a document detailing the procedures for the Office of Senate Fair Employment Practices in 1993.,© 2019 Cable News Network.

"(CNN) - Three family members have been charged in the killing of a security guard who told a customer at a Michigan Family Dollar store to wear a state-mandated face mask, officials said on Monday.,Calvin Munerlyn, 43, died at a Flint hospital after he was shot in the head Friday, said Michigan State Police Lt. David Kaiser. ,Ramonyea Travon Bishop, 23, Larry Edward Teague, 44, and Sharmel Lashe Teague, 45, have been charged with first-degree premeditated murder, along with other charges, the Genesee County Prosecutor's Office said in a statement on Monday.,Sharmel and Larry Teague are married, and Bishop is Sharmel's son, according to the prosecutor's office.,""From all indications, Mr. Munerlyn was simply doing his job in upholding the Governor's Executive Order related to the COVID-19 pandemic for the safety of store employees and customers,"" Genesee County Prosecutor David Leyton said in the statement. ,Munerlyn got into a verbal altercation with Sharmel Teague after telling Teague's daughter she needed a mask, according to the prosecutor's office. Surveillance video confirms the incident, Leyton said.,Sharmel Teague's daughter left the store, but ""Teague began yelling at Munerlyn who then told her to leave the store and instructed a cashier not to serve her,"" the prosecutor's office said.,Under an executive order from Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, all retail employees and customers have to wear a mask. ,Footage also shows that immediately after the altercation, the woman left in an SUV. But about 20 minutes later, the SUV returned. ,Two men -- identified as Bishop and Larry Teague -- entered the store, according to the statement. One of them yelled at Munerlyn about disrespecting his wife, Leyton said. The other man, later identified as Bishop, then allegedly shot the security guard, the statement said. ,""This is senseless. Over a mask. Over a mask?"" Munerlyn's cousin, Tina James, told CNN affiliate WJRT.  ""This is not the way to do things right now.  We need to come together."" ,Police are looking for Larry Teague and Bishop, the prosecutor's office said. ,Sharmel Teague is in custody and awaiting arraignment on her charges in 67th District Court. ,In addition to the murder charge, Bishop also faces charges of felony firearm and carrying a concealed weapon, the prosecutor's office said.,Larry Teague also faces two felony firearm-related charges, one charge of a felon in possession of a firearm, one charge of carrying a concealed weapon, and one of violating the governor's executive order, according to the prosecutor's office.,Sharmel Teague also faces a felony firearm charge, the statement said. She doesn't have a lawyer yet, John Potbury, deputy chief assistant prosecutor of Genesee County, told CNN.,Randy Guiler, Dollar Tree's vice president of investor relations, said the company is ""aware of the tragic incident."",""We will continue to cooperate fully with local authorities on their investigation,"" Guiler said in a statement to CNN. ""As always, we are committed to ensuring a safe environment for our associates and customers. Out of respect for the family's privacy, we are not commenting further at this time."",© 2019 Cable News Network. Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. All Rights Reserved."
"Washington  (CNN) - Face masks, it seems, have become a new fault line in America. ,The decision to wear or avoid them in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic signals whether people have chosen to adhere to public-health guidelines -- a stress that's playing out on personal and political levels.,For some, the tension over face masks has resulted in great personal loss. On May 1, Calvin Munerlyn, a security guard at a Michigan Family Dollar store, was shot to death while reportedly enforcing the state's policy to wear face coverings in enclosed public spaces.,""This is senseless. Over a mask. Over a mask?"" Tina James, Munerlyn's cousin, told CNN affiliate WJRT. ""This is not the way to do things right now. We need to come together."",Percolating beneath the more general pandemic stress is a political divide cleaving us over the role of government, science and even truth.,On April 30, some 400 to 700 protesters descended on the Michigan Capitol building to demonstrate against Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's stay-at-home order, which was issued in March following the declaration of a state of emergency that was set to expire at the end of the day. (She later signed executive orders that put in place a new state of emergency through May 28.),Conspicuously, most weren't wearing face masks.,Speaking with CNN's Jake Tapper on Sunday, Whitmer said that the protesters, whom President Donald Trump sided with, dredged up ""some of the worst racism and awful parts of our history in this country."",""The Confederate flags and nooses, the swastikas, the, you know, behavior that you've seen in all of the clips, is not representative of who we are in Michigan. And the fact of the matter is, I mean, we're in a global pandemic,"" she said, adding that ""we need to listen to the expertise and our institutions of higher learning and our health system and make decisions that are going to protect the lives of everyone."",This cultural and political divide has been apparent even beyond the extreme protests occurring across the country.,On April 30, the city of Stillwater, Oklahoma, issued an emergency proclamation requiring, among other things, the use of face coverings in stores and restaurants to slow the virus's spread. But officials amended it the next day, after a rash of verbal abuse and threats of physical violence.,""Many of those with objections cite the mistaken belief the requirement is unconstitutional, and under their theory, one cannot be forced to wear a mask,"" city manager Norman McNickle said in a statement, referring to what tends to be a conservative talking point in arguments in favor of flouting certain public-health guidance. ""No law or court supports this view. ... It is further distressing that these people, while exercising their believed rights, put others at risk."",(Notably, masks without medical-grade respirators are less for the wearers than the people around them whom they could unknowingly transmit the virus to.),This followed a similar U-turn elsewhere in the country. On April 28, Ohio's Republican Gov. Mike DeWine reversed an announcement he made the previous day requiring state residents to wear face masks in stores.,""It became clear to me that that was just a bridge too far, that people were not going to accept the government telling them what to do,"" he told ABC News on Sunday. ""Generally, Republicans are less inclined to have the government tell them what to do."",It's another instance of one side of the political aisle disbelieving or disregarding science. And in light of new modeling projecting that cases and deaths will increase as states ease restrictions, it's the kind of move that could threaten people's actual lives.,Crucially, there are people who obey or ignore medical authorities' recommendations without intending to advertise their political opinions. Moreover, some have legitimate reasons for being wary of wearing face masks.,""We have a lot of examples of the presumed criminality of black men in general,"" Trevon Logan, an economics professor at Ohio State University, told CNN in April. ""And then we have the advice to go out in public in something that ... can certainly be read as being criminal or nefarious, particularly when applied to black men."",That said, as parts of the country contemplate reopening, it's hard to ignore how these strange times have transformed face masks from tools to promote public health into statements with political valence -- and with very real consequences.,© 2019 Cable News Network.

"(CNN) - Masks and face coverings are recommended, even required, in many US supermarkets now. ,But a customer at a southern California grocery store chose to wear what appeared to be a Ku Klux Klan hood throughout his shopping trip and ignored requests from staff to remove it, according to the supermarket. ,Now, the San Diego County Sheriff's Department is looking into the incident and could pursue criminal charges. ,The customer was photographed by shoppers at Vons grocery store in Santee last weekend. An image of the person bagging fruit in the produce department while wearing the white hood, face fully covered except for two holes around the eyes, was shared by San Diego's Anti-Defamation League regional director Tammy Gillies.,In a statement to CNN, Vons said employees had asked the customer to remove the hood, but the customer ignored the requests until they made it to the checkout area. ,""This was a disturbing incident for our associates and customers, and we are reviewing with our team how to best handle such inappropriate situations in the future,"" Vons said in the statement. ,It's not clear whether the customer was allowed to check out with groceries or eventually removed the hood.,The Santee Vons where the incident occurred did not respond to CNN's repeated calls for comment. ,The San Diego County Sheriff's Department said deputies weren't called to the store at the time of the incident. But detectives are ""looking into the matter"" now and will pursue criminal charges if necessary, the department said in a statement. ,Customers were scared to approach,Customer Alisa Wentzel told CNN she spotted the shopper, whom she believes was a man, as soon as she entered the store. He was waiting in the checkout line, she said, wearing the hood. ,At first she didn't believe what she was seeing, she told CNN. ,Wentzel moved between aisles to sneak photos of him and keep her distance. ,""Management should be doing something, but I didn't see anyone talking to him,"" she said. ""He was just standing in line."" ,By the time she'd finished her shopping at the self-checkout lane some 30 minutes later, the man was in line waiting for a cashier, still wearing his hood, she said. ,""I just remember feeling so heartbroken, so hopeless and then also just really upset that this would happen in the community that I raise my family in,"" she said. ""I was just in utter shock and disbelief. I still feel that way."" ,Santee's reputation for racial intolerance,White hoods are one of the most obvious emblems of the Ku Klux Klan, a white supremacist hate group, and are considered a symbol of hate. Klansmen wore the hoods to disguise their identities while carrying out violent acts against black Americans. ,While the hate group has become less public in the 21st century, Americans continue to invoke the group's symbols. An apparent recruitment flier for the group was found last year in a Texas high school. An Alabama newspaper published an editorial calling for the return of the KKK. A police officer in Michigan was fired after his KKK memorabilia was found. ,Santee has been associated with white supremacist activity for years, earning the city the nickname ""Klantee,"" according to a 2001 Los Angeles Times article. Wentzel said the term is still used. ,It's a reputation the city has tried to shirk, even hiring a marketing company to boost its brand, according to the San Diego Union-Tribune. ,The city condemned this latest instance of racial intolerance. ,""Many thanks to all who stepped forward to curtail this sad reminder of intolerance,"" Santee Mayor John Minto said in a statement on behalf of Santee City Council. ​""Santee and its citizens are great, and this particular individual's actions are not representative of us as a people and a wonderful city."" ,© 2019 Cable News Network.
